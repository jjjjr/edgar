The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of accounting for income taxes As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $121.2 million of deferred tax assets, net and income tax benefit of $98.6 million as of and for the year ended June 27, 2020. Additionally, as discussed in Note 8, the Company recognized accrued income taxes of $34.6 million as of June 27, 2020. The Company conducts business globally and consequently is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes as well as foreign income taxes in many of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company exercises judgment for the interpretation and application of such current tax regulations. We identified the evaluation of the accounting for income taxes as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company's application of current tax regulations in various foreign jurisdictions and the impact of those regulations on foreign, U.S. federal and state income tax provisions requires complex auditor judgment, and the use of tax professionals with specialized skills. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's income tax 37 process, including controls over the application of current tax regulations in the Company's various tax jurisdictions and impact on the Company's tax provisions. We involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge in various tax jurisdictions, who assisted in evaluating the Company's analyses over the application of current tax regulations and assessing the Company's interpretation of tax laws and regulations in those jurisdictions. Assessment of goodwill impairment As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's goodwill balance was $773.7 million as of June 27, 2020. The Company performs goodwill testing on an annual basis and evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than its carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. The Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of March 28, 2020 as the Company identified indicators that goodwill was potentially not recoverable and recognized $118.7 million of goodwill impairment expense for the year ended June 27, 2020. The Company uses a combination of an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow methodology, and a market approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. We identified the assessment of goodwill impairment as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company's assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit's goodwill required complex auditor judgement. Specifically, the key assumptions in the assessment are future operating results, including forecasted sales, gross profit margins, operating expenses, growth rates, and discount rates used to measure the reporting units' fair values. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's goodwill impairment assessment process, including controls over the determination of the fair value of the reporting units, and controls over the key assumptions described above. We performed sensitivity analyses over the fair value model and forecasted sales, gross profit margins, and operating expenses to assess their impact on the Company's determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and compared the future operating results and historical growth rates to actual results. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: - Comparing the future operating results to industry data, economic growth data, and growth rates utilized in prior years' valuation analyses by the Company; and - Comparing the Company's discount rates to discount rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available third-party market data for comparable entities.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Specialty Alloys Operations and Additive Reporting Units As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated goodwill balance was $290.4 million as of June 30, 2020 and the goodwill associated with the Specialty Alloys Operations (SAO) and Additive reporting units was $195.5 million and $45.6 million, respectively. Goodwill is annually tested for impairment as of June 30, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The fair value is estimated using a weighting of discounted cash flows and market multiples valuation technique for the SAO reporting unit and is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique for the Additive reporting unit. As described by management, the Company has experienced slower than expected growth in the additive manufacturing industry with the effects being further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management determined the goodwill associated with the Additive reporting unit was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $34.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2020. The discounted cash flow technique requires the use of cash flow forecasts. The cash flow forecasts include significant judgments and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, which include perpetual growth rates, gross margin and weighted average cost of capital. The market multiples valuation technique includes significant judgment in the determination of the market multiples. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the SAO and Additive reporting units is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the SAO reporting unit using the discounted cash flow and market multiples valuation techniques and the Additive reporting unit using the discounted cash flow valuation technique, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management's significant assumptions related to (i) the revenue growth rates (which include perpetual growth rates) gross margin, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples for the SAO reporting unit and (ii) the revenue growth rates and weighted average cost of capital for the Additive reporting unit. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 46 Table of Contents Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company's reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value estimates, which included evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow and market multiples valuation techniques; (ii) testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the estimates; and (iii) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to the revenue growth rates (which include perpetual growth rates) gross margin, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples for the SAO reporting unit and the revenue growth rates and weighted average cost of capital for the Additive reporting unit . Evaluating management's assumptions related to the revenue growth rates (which include perpetual growth rates) gross margin, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples as applicable to the relevant reporting units, involved evaluating whether the assumptions were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are tested by the Company's management for impairment at least annually, in the fiscal fourth quarter, unless there are indications of impairment at other points throughout the year. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Auditing the Company's annual impairment test for goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives is complex and highly judgmental and required the involvement of a valuation specialist due to the significant judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives. In particular, the fair value estimates of reporting units with fair values that do not significantly exceed their carrying values are sensitive to assumptions such as net sales growth rates, gross margins and discount rates. Trademarks with indefinite lives with fair values that do not significantly exceed their carrying values are sensitive to assumptions such as net sales growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. All of these assumptions are sensitive to and affected by expected future market or economic conditions, particularly those in emerging markets, and industry and company-specific qualitative factors. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill and trademarks impairment review process. This included evaluating controls over the Company's budgetary and forecasting process used to develop the estimated future earnings and cash flows used in estimating the fair value of reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives. We also tested controls over management's review of the data used in their valuation models and review of the significant assumptions such as estimation of net sales, expense growth rates and terminal growth rates. To test the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives (with fair values that do not significantly exceed carrying values), we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies, testing the significant assumptions discussed above used to develop the estimates of future earnings and cash flows and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, the Company's historical results and other guideline companies within the same industry, and evaluated whether changes in the Company's business would affect the significant assumptions. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives resulting from changes in these assumptions. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in reviewing the valuation methodology and testing the terminal growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. In addition, for goodwill we also tested the Company's calculation of implied multiples of the reporting units, compared them to guideline companies and evaluated the resulting premium. For trademarks with indefinite lives, where applicable, we also assessed whether the assumptions used were consistent with those used in the goodwill impairment review process. 26 Valuation of Venture Agreement Terminal Obligation Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company has an agreement with The Proctor &amp; Gamble Company (P&amp;G) for the Company's Glad bags and wraps business, for which the Company is required to purchase P&amp;G's 20% interest in the venture for cash at fair value of the global Glad business upon termination of the agreement. At June 30, 2020, the fair value of $400 million has been recognized as a venture agreement terminal obligation and represented 8% of total liabilities. Auditing the Company's Glad venture agreement terminal obligation is complex and highly judgmental and required the involvement of a valuation specialist due to the significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the global Glad business. In particular, the fair value estimate is sensitive to assumptions such as net sales growth rates, gross margins, discount rate and commodity prices. These assumptions are sensitive to and affected by expected future market or economic conditions, particularly those in emerging markets, and industry and company-specific qualitative factors. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the venture agreement terminal obligation valuation review process. This included controls over the Company's budgetary and forecasting process used to develop the estimated fair value of the global Glad business. We also tested management's controls over the data used in their valuation models and review of the significant assumptions such as estimation of net sales, expense growth rates, terminal growth rates and commodity prices. To test the estimated fair value of the venture agreement terminal obligation, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies, testing the significant assumptions discussed above used to develop estimates of future earnings and cash flows, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, the Company's historical results and other guideline companies within the same industry, and evaluated whether changes in the Company's business, including shifts in consumer demands and commodity prices, would affect the significant assumptions. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the venture agreement terminal obligation resulting from changes in these assumptions. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in reviewing the valuation methodology and testing the terminal growth rates and discount rates.

The Company accrues costs for product liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be estimated. Each product liability claim is evaluated based on its specific facts and circumstances, and a judgment is then made to determine the requirement for establishment or revision of an accrual for any potential liability. An accrual for unasserted claims or for premature claims is based, in part, on management's expectations for future litigation activity and the settled claims history. The Company periodically reviews such estimates, and any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. At December 31, 2019, the Company's product liability reserve balance totaled $117 million. &#160; Auditing management's estimate of loss contingencies arising from product liability claims was complex and included evaluating the likelihood and amount of loss for asserted and unasserted claims, which are subjective and require significant judgment. - 46 - How we addressed the matter in our audit We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's identification and evaluation of product liability claims, including the reserve on unasserted claims, including management's review of the estimation model used to establish the best estimate of the required reserve, and the data inputs used in the estimation model. &#160; Our audit procedures to test the adequacy and completeness of management's assessment of the probability of loss included, among others, reviews of legal correspondence related to claims identified by management, reviews of confirmation letters obtained from internal and external legal counsel, inquiries of internal and external legal counsel to discuss asserted and known unasserted claims, and review of written representations obtained from the Company. In order to test the measurement of the product liability litigation reserve, we evaluated the Company's estimation model used to establish the reserve for claims, asserted and unasserted, and tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used in management's estimation model. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses over management's estimated range of losses in order to evaluate the magnitude of potential impact on the liability resulting from changes in assumptions. Lastly, we assessed the competency of management's estimation model by performing hindsight analyses to assess the adequacy of prior estimates. &#160; "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/24491/000002449120000028

Maximum Leverage Ratio Covenant Compliance and Related Availability Under the Company's Credit Agreement As described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company continues to assess the expected conditions in its primary end markets, including the effects of COVID-19 on the Company's business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Because the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain, the effects of the pandemic could materially affect the Company's availability to borrow under the five-year, multi-currency, revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in June 2018 (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) and the compliance with the maximum leverage ratio covenant of the Credit Agreement. As disclosed in Note 12, if over the course of the next year, market conditions do not improve or further deteriorate, the Company may need to take one or a combination of the following additional actions to ensure the Company has adequate access to liquidity and remains in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio covenant of the Credit Agreement, all of which are within the Company's control: implement additional short-term cost-control actions, temporarily reduce or suspend the dividend, and undertake new restructuring programs. The Company has concluded that it will remain in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Agreement and, as a result, will have adequate access to liquidity to satisfy its obligations within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company's maximum leverage ratio covenant compliance and related availability under the Company's Credit Agreement is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when evaluating the uncertainty related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, which impacts the Company's forecasted operating results and maximum leverage ratio covenant compliance; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management's (i) forecasted operating results, which included significant assumptions related to future revenues and operating margins and (ii) assessment of compliance with the maximum leverage ratio covenant of the Credit Agreement within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.

Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating whether the future revenue and operating margin assumptions were reasonable considering the consistency with external market and industry data. The procedures also included evaluation of management's conclusions and their disclosure in the consolidated financial statements regarding availability of funds under and compliance with the maximum leverage ratio covenant in the Credit Agreement. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Assessments - Widia Reporting Unit and WIDIA Trademark As described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's goodwill balance was $270.6 million and other intangible assets, net was $132.6 million as of June 30, 2020. The goodwill associated with the Widia reporting unit was $0 million, and the carrying value of the WIDIA trademark indefinite-lived intangible asset was $11.2 million. Impairment 36 Table of Contents charges of $26.8 million and $3.4 million were recorded against the Widia reporting unit and the WIDIA trademark, respectively, during the year ended June 30, 2020. Management performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the June quarter, unless there are impairment indicators based on the results of an ongoing cumulative qualitative assessment that warrant a test prior to that quarter. Management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill for each of its reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair value is determined using a combination of a market multiples approach and a discounted cash flow analysis based upon historical and projected financial information. As disclosed by management, estimating fair value of each reporting unit requires various assumptions, including revenue and gross margin growth rates, expected capital expenditures to determine projected cash flows, expected tax rates and an estimated discount rate. Management evaluates the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information. Estimating fair value of the indefinite-lived asset requires various assumptions, including revenue growth rate, an estimated royalty rate and an estimated discount rate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments of the Widia reporting unit and the WIDIA trademark is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the Widia reporting unit and the WIDIA trademark, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to management's significant assumptions related to the revenue and gross margin growth rates and discount rate for goodwill and the revenue growth rate and discount rate for the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue As discussed in Notes&#160;1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had $2,848.6 million in revenues for the year ended June&#160;30, 2020, of which $1,399.0 million was advertising related, $1,348.7 million was consumer related, and $100.9 million was related to other revenue streams. Each of these categories of revenue has multiple revenue streams, and the Company's process for revenue recognition differs between these discrete revenue streams. We identified the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter required especially subjective auditor judgment because of the number of revenue streams, related revenue recognition processes, number of information technology (IT) applications involved, and the need to involve IT professionals to assist with the performance of certain procedures. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. Based on our knowledge of the Company, we applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue, including the determination of the revenue streams over which those procedures were performed. For each revenue stream where procedures were performed, we: - evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the processing and recording of revenue, - assessed the recorded revenue by selecting transactions and comparing the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including agreements and other relevant and reliable third-party data, and - involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the identification and testing of certain IT systems and related controls that are used by the Company in its revenue recognition process. In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained over revenue. Valuation of goodwill for the national media reporting unit As discussed in Notes&#160;1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill balance as of June&#160;30, 2020 was $1,719.3 million, of which $1,602.7 million related to the national media reporting unit. The Company performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis or when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value exceeds the fair value. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company determined that interim triggering events, including declines in the price of its stock and the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, required an interim evaluation of goodwill at March&#160;31, 2020. The impairment test determined the carrying value of goodwill in the national media reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the national media segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 to its fair value. We identified the evaluation of goodwill for the national media reporting unit as a critical audit matter because it involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment. This evaluation included assessing assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, such as forecasted revenue growth rates, estimated costs, and the discount rate which were challenging to test as they required forward-looking assumptions. Additionally, minor changes to include those assumptions had a significant effect on the Company's assessment of the reporting unit's fair value. Assessing the implied control premium derived from the market capitalization 60 reconciliation was also challenging as it required assistance from valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge of the matter. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.

66382	 HERMAN MILLER INC	 OFFICE FURNITURE [2520]	"Critical Audit Matter s The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of acquired intangible assets - HAY acquisition As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company purchased an additional 34% equity voting interest of HAY on December 2, 2019, for net consideration of $79.0 million. The transaction increased the Company's ownership to 67%, resulting in a controlling financial interest and was accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the purchase price, inclusive of the remeasurement of the previously held equity interest and non-controlling interest, was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified intangible assets of $118.9 million. To value the identified intangible assets, which included a tradename, product development and technology, and customer relationships, the Company used the income approach. The process required management to make significant judgments around the estimates and assumptions that would be used by a market participant, which included forecasted revenue growth rates, operating margins, royalty rates, and discount rates. We identified the evaluation of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in the HAY acquisition as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair values of the tradename, product development and technology, and customer relationship intangibles. Specifically, subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the selection of forecasted revenue growth rates, operating margins, royalty rates, and discount rates used to estimate the fair values of the intangibles. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in the HAY acquisition required specialized skills and knowledge. 91 2020 Annual Report The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We tested the design and evaluated the effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's acquisition-date valuation process, including controls over the selection of forecasted revenue growth rates, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates used to estimate the fair value of the HAY tradename, product development and technology, and customer relationship intangibles. We evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasted revenue growth rates and operating margins by comparing the forecasts to historical revenue growth rates and operating margins. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of reasonably possible changes to the key estimates and assumptions on the fair value of the acquired intangibles. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: - evaluating the Company's discount rates by comparing the Company's inputs to the discount rates to publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rates, - evaluating the Company's royalty rates by comparing the selected royalty rates to the forecasted operating margins of HAY and publicly available data for comparable licensing agreements and assessing the resulting royalty rates, and - testing the estimate of the fair values of the HAY tradename, product development and technology, and customer relationship intangibles using the Company's cash flow estimates and discount rates, and comparing the results to the Company's fair value estimates. Goodwill impairment assessment As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated goodwill balance was $346.0 million as of May 30, 2020, of which $163.7 million, $0.0 million, and $0.0 million was related to the International, Maharam, and Retail reporting units, respectively. During the fourth quarter of the year ended May 30, 2020, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $36.7 million, and $88.8 million related to the Maharam and Retail reporting units, respectively. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. To estimate the fair value of its reporting units, the Company utilized an income approach and a market approach that used observable comparable company information. We identified the evaluation of goodwill for impairment for the International, Maharam, and Retail reporting units as a critical audit matter. Subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the selection of forecasted revenue growth rates, operating margins, and discount rates used in the income approach. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of goodwill for impairment for the International, Maharam, and Retail reporting units required specialized skills and knowledge. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.

We evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasted revenue growth rates and operating margins by comparing the forecasts to historical revenue growth rates and operating margins, considering industry conditions and growth plans. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of reasonably possible changes to the forecasted revenue growth rates, operating margins, and discount rate assumptions on the reporting unit fair values. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: - evaluating the Company's discount rates by comparing the Company's inputs to the discount rates to publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rates, and - testing the estimate of fair value for the International, Maharam, and Retail reporting units using the Company's cash flow assumptions and discount rates and comparing the results to the Company's fair value estimates. Herman Miller, Inc. and Subsidiaries 92 Tradename impairment assessment As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the indefinite-lived intangible asset balance as of May 30, 2020 was $31.5 million, $39.3 million and $16.5 million related to the DWR (Design Within Reach), HAY, and Maharam tradenames, respectively. During the fourth quarter of the year ended May 30, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $23.6 million, $20.7 million and $6.5 million related to the DWR, HAY, and Maharam tradenames, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset has declined below its carrying value. To estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief from royalty method. We identified the evaluation of the DWR, HAY, and Maharam tradenames for impairment as a critical audit matter. Subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the selection of forecasted revenue growth rates, discount rates, and royalty rates used to estimate the fair values of the DWR, HAY and Maharam tradenames. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of the DWR, HAY, and Maharam tradenames for impairment required specialized skills and knowledge. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's impairment evaluation for tradenames, including controls over the selection of forecasted revenue growth rates, discount rates, and royalty rates used to estimate the fair value of the DWR, HAY, and Maharam tradenames. We evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasted revenue growth rates by comparing the forecasts to historical revenue growth rates, considering industry conditions and growth plans. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of reasonably possible changes to the forecasted revenue growth rates, discount rate, and royalty rate assumptions on the fair values of the tradenames. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: - evaluating the Company's discount rates by comparing the Company's inputs to the discount rates to publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rates; - evaluating the Company's royalty rates by comparing the selected royalty rates to the forecasted operating margins of the sales associated with the tradenames and publicly available data for comparable licensing agreements and assessing the resulting royalty rates, and - testing the estimate of fair value of the DWR, HAY, and Maharam indefinite-lived tradenames using the Company's estimated future revenue growth assumptions, royalty rates, and discount rates, and comparing the results to the Company's fair value estimates. Long-lived asset impairment assessment As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the DWR asset group, including right-of-use assets, was $122.7 million as of May 30, 2020. During the fourth quarter of the year ended May 30, 2020, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $26.6 million related to right-of-use assets, customer relationships, and other long-lived assets within the DWR asset group. The Company performs an impairment assessment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If a triggering event is identified, the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to its estimated fair value. To estimate the fair value of the asset group, the Company utilized an income approach for customer relationships, a market approach for right-of-use assets and a cost approach for other long-lived assets. We identified the evaluation of the fair value of the right-of-use assets within the DWR asset group as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate fair value. Specifically, subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to assess 1) relevant market-based rental comparatives adjusted for industry data trends, and 2) consideration of the remaining lease term, which were used to estimate the fair values of the right-of-use assets. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of the fair value of the right-of-use assets within the DWR asset group required specialized skills and knowledge. 93 2020 Annual Report &#160;&#160; The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We tested the design and evaluated the effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's long-lived asset impairment assessment process, including controls over the determination of market-based rental comparatives, industry data trends, and consideration of the remaining lease term used to estimate the fair value of the right-of-use assets. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the right-of-use assets by comparing the assumptions to 1) available market-based rental comparatives adjusted for industry data trends, and 2) considerations of the remaining lease term.

The communication of critical audit matters do not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of Goodwill Description of the Matter At June 27, 2020, the Company's goodwill was $3.7 billion. As discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements, goodwill is tested by the Company's management for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, unless there are indications of impairment at other points throughout the fiscal year. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. During the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020, the Company recorded $203 million of impairment charges to goodwill. Auditing management's impairment tests for goodwill is complex and highly judgmental and required the involvement of a valuation specialist due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimates of reporting units with fair values that do not significantly exceed their carrying values are sensitive to assumptions such as changes in projected cash flows, weighted average cost of capital, and terminal growth rates. All of these assumptions are sensitive to and affected by expected future market or economic conditions and company-specific qualitative factors. 62 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review process, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above. We also tested controls over management's review of the data used in their valuation models. To test the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared projected cash flows to the Company's historical cash flows and other available industry information. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in reviewing the valuation methodology and testing the weighted average cost of capital and terminal growth rates. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. In addition, we also tested management's reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Description of the Matter The Company's accounts receivable totaled $2.9 billion, net of allowance of doubtful accounts for $335 million, as of June 27, 2020. As discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements, the Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors, including, among others, historical write-off experience, customer bankruptcies and accounts referred to outside collection agencies. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to those factors, the allowance also incorporates the Company's historical write-off percentages experienced during local and regional disasters and the Company's current collection trends experienced during the pandemic. Auditing management's estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts involved subjectivity because the estimates rely on industry and economic factors. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant and adverse impact on the credit worthiness of Sysco's customers in the foodservice industry, and there is a high degree of subjectivity around estimating the write-off percentages utilized in the allowance for doubtful accounts calculation. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts review process, including controls over management's review of historical write-off percentages experienced during local and regional disasters and current collection trends experienced during the pandemic. We also tested controls over management's review of the data used in their calculation. To test the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the Company's write-off percentages and the data used by the Company in its calculation. We compared the write-off percentages utilized in the calculation to the Company's historical write-off percentages experienced during local and regional disasters. We performed analyses on the Company's current collection trends experienced during the pandemic and obtained evidence for select accounts referred to outside collection agencies or customers that have filed for bankruptcy. Additionally, we evaluated events subsequent to the balance sheet date in assessing the reasonableness of management's estimates. "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/96021/000009602120000100

Assessment of variable consideration for sales to resellers As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides resellers with price protection and other sales incentive programs. The Company uses judgment in its assessment of variable consideration in contracts to be included in the transaction price. The Company's estimate of variable consideration for sales to resellers is based on several factors, including historical pricing information, current pricing trends, and channel inventory levels. We identified the assessment of variable consideration for sales to resellers as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the assumptions used by the Company to estimate the variable consideration, specifically anticipated price decreases based on historical pricing information, current pricing trends, and channel inventory levels during the expected reseller holding period, required a higher degree of auditor judgment due to the uncertainty involved in the estimate. The primary procedures performed to address this critical audit matter include the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's process of determining the variable consideration, including controls related to the development of the assumption of anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period. We evaluated the Company's ability to accurately estimate the assumptions used to determine the variable consideration by comparing historically recorded variable consideration to actual subsequent payments and credits. We developed an expectation of the variable consideration for resellers based on historically recorded variable consideration and compared it to the actual variable consideration. We developed an expectation of the variable consideration for resellers based on subsequent payments and credits issued and compared it to the actual variable consideration.

Quantitative Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB and Display Reporting Units As described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated goodwill balance was $2.0 billion as of June 30, 2020, and the goodwill associated with the Specialty Semiconductor Process (&#8220;SSP&#8221;) and PCB and Display reporting units was $681.9 million and $907.2 million, respectively. Management recorded charges of $144.2 million and $112.5 million for the impairment of goodwill related to the SSP and PCB and Display reporting units, respectively, during the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Management tests goodwill for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. To determine the fair value of the reporting units, management utilized the results derived from income and market valuation approaches and applied a weighting of 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The income approach is estimated through a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was computed by adding the present value of the estimated annual discounted cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This valuation technique requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and other inputs. The market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for the SSP and PCB and Display reporting units is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value of the reporting units, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the long-term growth rates and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and controls over development of the related assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for determining the fair value of the reporting units, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches, (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the estimate, and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions related to the long-term growth rates and the discount rates. Evaluating management's assumptions related to the long-term growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the long-term growth rates and discount rates assumptions. 114 Table of Contents Uncertain Tax Positions Related to the Ongoing Israeli Tax Authority Matter As described in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions arising from a tax assessment and subsequent Tax Decrees received from the Israel Tax Authority (&#8220;ITA&#8221;). The calculation of the Company's tax liabilities associated with the ongoing ITA matter involves dealing with the application of complex tax regulations. Management recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management re-evaluates uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the uncertain tax positions related to the ongoing ITA matter is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when evaluating uncertain tax positions and the application of complex tax regulations, which in turn led to significant audit effort in performing procedures to evaluate the timely identification and accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions. Also, the evaluation of audit evidence available to support the liability for uncertain tax positions is complex as the nature of the evidence is often subjective, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the liability for uncertain tax positions, and controls addressing completeness of the uncertain tax positions, as well as controls over measurement of the liability. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the information used in the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions related to the ongoing ITA matter, including evaluating international filing positions, the related final tax returns and communications between the Company and the tax authorities; (ii) testing the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions by jurisdiction, including management's assessment of the technical merits of tax positions related to the ITA matter and estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained for the matter; and (iii) testing the completeness of management's assessment of both the identification of uncertain tax positions and possible outcomes of each uncertain tax position. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the completeness and measurement of the liability for uncertain tax positions related to the ITA matter, including evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of whether tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained, the amount of potential benefit to be realized, and the application of relevant tax laws.

The total goodwill balance as of June 24, 2020 was $187.6 million , of which $149.2 million was allocated to the Chili's reporting unit and $38.4 million was allocated to the Maggiano's reporting unit. In March 2020, the impact from the spreading of a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic was declared a National Public Health Emergency and resulted in a significant reduction in sales at the Company's restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as social distancing practices, dining room closures and other restrictions were mandated or encouraged by federal, state and local governments. This also resulted in a significant decline in market capitalization at March 25, 2020, the end of the Company's fiscal third quarter. As a result, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred, which required the performance of a goodwill impairment test to assess the carrying value of goodwill. The Company determined that goodwill was not impaired. We identified the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment, and the need to involve professionals with specialized skills in valuation methodology, was required to evaluate the forecasted future revenues and the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model to determine the fair values of the Company's reporting units. In addition, due to the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business, there was significant uncertainty associated with these inputs. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's goodwill impairment assessment process, including controls related to the development of the inputs described above. We evaluated the Company's forecasted revenue assumptions by comparing historical revenue and guest traffic patterns to the Company's estimate of future patterns as restaurants began to resume dine-in service. We compared the Company's forecasted revenue assumptions to actual results subsequent to the date of the goodwill impairment test. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: - evaluating the Company's discount rate, by comparing it against a discount rate that was independently developed using publicly available third-party market data for comparable entities, and; - assessing the Company's calculated fair values of its reporting units on a combined basis compared to the Company's market capitalization. Assessment of the gift card breakage revenue As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, gift card breakage revenue represents the monetary value associated with outstanding gift card balances that will not be redeemed. The Company estimates this amount based on the historical gift card redemption patterns and recognizes the estimated breakage as revenue in proportion to the pattern of related gift card redemptions. The gift card breakage revenue recognized for the year ended June 24, 2020 was approximately $15.8 million . We identified the assessment of the gift card breakage revenue as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the trends in historical and expected future redemption patterns used to estimate breakage revenue. 92 Table of Contents The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's gift card breakage revenue process including controls related to the gift card activation and redemption data used to develop the breakage rate. We assessed breakage revenue by comparing the data used to estimate the breakage rate and recognition pattern to the actual redemption activity. We evaluated the Company's estimate of the period of time over which to recognize breakage revenue by analyzing subsequent redemption activity.

As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company assesses the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Auditing management's estimates for excess and obsolete inventory involved subjective auditor judgment because management's assessment of whether a write down is required and the measurement of any excess of cost over net realizable value is judgmental and considers a number of qualitative factors that are affected by market and economic conditions outside the Company's control. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We evaluated and tested the Company's processes and the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls addressing the identified audit risks. This included controls over management's assessment of inventory valuation, including the development of forecasted usage of inventories and consideration of how factors outside of the Company's control might affect management's judgment related to the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions (e.g., forecasts related to the Company's future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, and possible alternative uses) and the underlying data used in management's excess and obsolete inventory valuation assessment. We evaluated inventory levels compared to forecasted demand, historical sales and specific product considerations. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Goodwill Impairment Assessment as of March 31, 2020 &#8211; Franchise Reporting Unit As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated goodwill balance was $227.5 million as of June 30, 2020, which is fully attributed to the Franchise reporting unit. Management assesses goodwill impairment on an annual basis as of April 30, 2020, and between annual assessments if an event occurs, or circumstances change, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company determined a triggering event occurred, resulting in quantitative impairment tests performed over the goodwill. This determination was made considering the reduced sales and profitability projections for the reporting unit, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruption. As a result of the triggering event impairment testing, the Franchise reporting unit was determined to have a fair value that exceeded carrying value by approximately 50 percent. The fair value of the Franchise reporting unit was determined based on a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market model. The significant assumptions used in determining fair value for the March 31, 2020 assessment were the, number of salons to be sold to franchisees and the discount rate. Management subsequently updated the triggering event impairment assessment with its annual impairment test of the Franchise reporting unit as of April 30, 2020. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill triggering event impairment assessment of the Franchise reporting unit is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value measurement of the reporting unit, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (i) management's discounted cash flow model (ii) significant assumptions related to the number of salons to be sold to franchisees and the discount rate. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 52 Table of Contents Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's triggering event goodwill impairment assessment for the Franchise reporting unit, including controls over the valuation of the Franchise reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others,(i) testing management's process for determining fair value of the reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management relating to the number of salons to be sold to franchisees and the discount rate. Evaluating management's assumption related to the number of existing franchised salons and the number of salons to be sold to franchisees involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management were reasonable considering current and past performance of the reporting unit and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company's discounted future cash flow model and the discount rate assumption. Right of Use Asset Impairment Assessment for the Salon Asset Groups As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated Right of Use Asset (ROUA) balance was $786.2 million as of June 30, 2020. As a result of COVID-19 and the related store closures that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, management determined that a triggering event had occurred and was required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment in the fourth fiscal quarter fiscal 2020. The Company first assessed all of its salon asset groups, which included the ROU assets, to determine if the carrying value was recoverable, which is determined by comparing the net carrying value of the salon asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. For the salon asset groups that failed the recoverability test, an impairment loss was measured as the amount by which the asset group exceeds its fair value. As described by management, the results of this assessment indicated that the estimated fair value of a portion of the Company's salon asset groups did not exceed the carrying value and an impairment charge was recorded in the amount of $17.4 million to the ROUA balance. The fair value of the salon asset groups were determined from the perspective of a market participant considering various factors. The significant judgments and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the salon asset groups were the market rent of comparable properties based on recently negotiated leases as applicable, asset group's projected sales for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 for properties with no recently negotiated leases, and a discount rate. The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist with significant inputs and assumptions utilized in the measurement of the impairment loss. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the ROUA impairment assessment of the salon asset groups that failed the long-lived asset recoverability test is a critical audit matter are the significant judgement by management when developing the fair value measurement of the asset groups, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (i) management's methods and calculations and, (ii) significant judgments and assumptions related to the market rent of comparable properties based on recently negotiated leases as applicable, asset group's projected sales for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 for properties with no recently negotiated leases, and the discount rate. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's ROUA impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the salon asset groups. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value of the salon asset groups; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the market participant approach methods; (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the estimates; and (iv) evaluating the significant judgments and assumptions used by management, which are the market rent of comparable properties based on recently negotiated leases, as applicable, asset group's projected sales for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 for properties with no recently negotiated leases, and the discount rate. Evaluating management's judgments and assumptions relating to market rent of comparable properties of recently negotiated leases involved obtaining recently negotiated leases to evaluate whether the fair market monthly rent used in the method was consistent with the executed agreements. Evaluating management's assumptions relating to the market comparable properties based on asset group's projected sales for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 sales involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering current and past performance of the asset group, industry data and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company's market participant approach methods and the discount rate assumption. 53 Table of Contents "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/716643/000071664320000042

As discussed in Note 1 &#160;to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. Auditing management's goodwill impairment test for the Medical Unit was challenging because there is significant judgement required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant judgmental assumptions including the revenue growth rate, gross margin, distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company specific risk premium, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of significant judgmental assumptions, including the revenue growth rate, gross margin, distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company specific risk premium, among other assumptions. To test the estimated fair value of the Medical Unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating methodologies used, involving our valuation specialists in testing the significant assumptions described above and testing the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis for completeness and accuracy. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, recent historical performance, changes to the reporting unit's business model, customer base or product mix and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. We evaluated the incorporation of the applicable assumptions into the model and tested the model's computational accuracy. In addition, we inspected the Company's reconciliation of the fair value of all reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company and assessed the result. &#160; 45 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K &#160; Reports &#160; &#160; &#160; Product Liability Lawsuits Description of the Matter As described in Note 1 &#160;and Note 7 &#160;to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a defendant in various product liability claims in which individuals seek damages associated with the use of Cordis OptEase and TrapEase inferior vena cava (IVC) filter products. The Company accrues for losses and defense costs related to product liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The methodology used by the Company to project future Cordis IVC claim costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim filing rates, indemnity severity by claim type, sales data, implant and injury to report lag patterns, and defense costs. The Company periodically reviews such estimates and records adjustments for changes in reserves in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. At June 30, 2020, the Company's product liability reserve balance related to the Cordis IVC lawsuits totaled $468 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries. The Company believes there is a range of estimated losses with respect to these matters. Because no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the Company has accrued the minimum amount in the range. The Company estimates the high end of the range to be approximately $919 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries. &#160; Auditing management's accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies related to the Cordis IVC product liability lawsuits was challenging due to the significant judgment required to develop the key assumptions utilized in the model and the nature of information available given the early stages of these lawsuits and the limited claims history. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's evaluation of the product liability litigation reserve. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the model used to estimate the product liability reserve amount and the significant assumptions as described above used within the model. We also tested management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the model. To test management's assessment of the probability of occurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable, we evaluated, for example, claims data of the Company, we evaluated the legal letters obtained from internal and external legal counsel, and we discussed with internal and external legal counsel of the plaintiffs' claims. Among other procedures we performed to test the measurement of the product liability litigation reserve, we evaluated the method of measuring the reserve for claims including analyses to determine the range of possible losses, obtained and performed audit procedures relative to the analysis, tested the accuracy and completeness of the data, and evaluated new or contrary information affecting the estimate. In addition, we involved internal actuarial specialists to assist with our procedures related to the measurement of the product liability reserve. We have also assessed the adequacy of the Company's disclosures included in Note 7 &#160;in relation to these matters. &#160; Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As described in Note 8 &#160;to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's unrecognized tax benefits related to its uncertain tax positions were approximately $998 million at June 30, 2020. Uncertain tax positions may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Auditing management's estimate of the amount of tax benefit related to the Company's uncertain tax positions that qualified for recognition was challenging because management's estimate required significant judgment in evaluating the technical merits of the positions, including interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to assess the technical merits of its uncertain tax positions, including the Company's assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and management's process to measure the benefit of its tax positions. &#160; We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and national tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company's tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, where applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company's analysis. For example, we evaluated the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based, and, where applicable, obtained the Company's correspondence with local tax authorities. We used our knowledge of international and local income tax laws, as well as historical settlement activity, where applicable, with local income tax authorities, to evaluate the Company's accounting for its uncertain tax positions. We evaluated developments in the applicable tax jurisdictions to assess potential effects on the Company's positions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to evaluate the appropriateness of the Company's measurement of tax benefits. We have also evaluated the Company's income tax disclosures in relation to these matters. &#160; Cardinal Health | &#160;Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 46 Reports &#160; &#160; &#160; Opioid Lawsuits Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 7 &#160;to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state governments and other political subdivisions related to opioid matters. The Company accrues for losses related to legal matters at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In October 2019, the Company agreed in principal to a global settlement framework (the &#8220;Settlement Framework&#8221;). The Settlement Framework is subject to contingencies and uncertainties as to final terms, however, it is the basis for the Company's negotiation of definitive terms. The Company has accrued $5.56 billion pretax under the cash component of the Settlement Framework as of June 30, 2020 and is unable to reasonably estimate the liability associated with other components. Additionally, management is unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with these matters. Auditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies related to the opioid lawsuits was challenging due to the significant judgment required to evaluate management's assessment of the likelihood of a loss being incurred and management's determination of whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss can be made. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of this legal contingency. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the assessment of the probability of occurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable and whether the assessment considered all relevant facts. To test the Company's assessment of the probability of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable, among other procedures, we read the Settlement Framework, requested and received internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, met with internal counsel to discuss the status of the proceedings and negotiations of the Settlement Framework, and evaluated the reasonableness of management's assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable. We also assessed the adequacy and the sufficiency of the Company's disclosures included in Note 7 &#160;in relation to these matters.

As described in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company's insurance reserve represents the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims primarily related to workers' compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure. The insurance reserve is estimated through actuarial procedures and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for Company specific expectations based on claims history. Auditing the Company's estimate of the insurance reserve is judgmental and complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the value of asserted claims including their loss development as well as the potential value of unasserted claims, which are developed with the assistance of a third-party actuarial specialist. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's insurance reserve. This includes internal controls over the claims activity and actuarial methods used to establish the insurance reserve. Specifically, we tested internal controls related to management's review of data provided to the actuary, validation of claim activity and review of actuarial methods. To test the insurance reserve, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to estimate the insurance reserve and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data, vouching payments made to third parties and testing the mathematical accuracy of the actuarially determined insurance reserve. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating the methodologies used by management to determine the insurance reserve and comparing the Company's recorded insurance reserve to a range developed based on independently selected actuarial methodologies.

Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Insurance Reserves - Workers' Compensation Insurance Reserves As described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers workers' compensation insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers' compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers' compensation insurance policies. Workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. As of May 31, 2020, the total liability for workers' compensation insurance reserves is $173.6 million. In establishing the workers&apos; compensation insurance reserves, management uses an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims. The evaluation, review and determination of estimated ultimate losses by the Company's appointed actuary are based on actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon estimated loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees' job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to PEO insurance reserves - workers' compensation insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the workers' compensation insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing our procedures and evaluating management's assumptions and actuarial estimates related to the estimated loss development factors and other factors such as the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends, and (ii) the audit effort included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Write-down for Excess or Obsolete Inventories As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the total inventories balance was $259.6 million as of June 27, 2020. Inventories are stated at the lower of (i) standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in-first-out basis, or (ii) net realizable value. A write-down to net realizable value is recorded if excess quantities or obsolescence is identified. At each reporting period, management assesses the Company's ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on the projected sales outlook. This assessment, which requires significant judgment by management, includes analysis of projections of future demand. Because of the cyclical nature of the market, inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, management generally writes down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted product demand. As disclosed by management, the Company had net inventory write-downs of $16.5 million during fiscal year 2020. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the write-down of excess or obsolete inventories is a critical audit matter are the significant amount of judgment by management in developing the assumptions of the forecasted product demand, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the forecasted product demand.

Revenue Recognition - estimating variable consideration and identification of and accounting for performance obligations As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded revenue of $1.697 billion for the year ended June 30, 2020. The Company enters into contracts with its customers, which frequently contain multiple performance obligations and variable contract consideration. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. The Company's contracts with its customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration. Management estimates variable consideration in its contract primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. Where appropriate, the Company may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount. At contract inception, management assesses the solutions and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - that is, if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. The Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer. Significant judgment in revenue recognition for these customer contracts include, where relevant, (i) the estimation of variable consideration, principally, the varying volume of transactional activity over long-term contracts, and (ii) the identification of and accounting for all performance obligations. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the estimation of variable consideration and the identification of and accounting for performance obligations is a critical audit matter are significant judgment by management to estimate the variable consideration, principally, the varying volume of transactional activity and the identification of and accounting for all performance obligations in a contract. This in turn resulted in significant audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing our audit procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence obtained. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including the estimation of variable consideration and identification of and accounting for each performance obligation. The procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management's process for determining the variable consideration and testing the reasonableness of management's estimation of variable consideration. Testing the estimation of variable consideration included evaluating the terms and conditions of the long-term contracts and the related significant assumptions used in the estimate of the variable consideration, principally, the varying volume of transactional activity. The procedures for testing the performance obligations and variable consideration included evaluation of the terms and conditions for a sample of contracts.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The consideration paid in the acquisition must be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed generally based on their fair value with the excess of the purchase price over those fair values allocated to goodwill. Auditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Finisar was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty involved in estimating the fair value of certain customer relationship and technology intangible assets. The total fair value ascribed to customer relationship and technology intangible assets amounted to $323.8 million and $334.7 million, respectively. The Company used the multi-period excess earnings method and the relief from royalty method to value the customer relationship and technology intangible assets, respectively. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of customer relationships included the forecasted revenue growth and projected operating expenses inclusive of expected synergies, including future cost savings, and other benefits expected to be achieved by combining the Company and Finisar. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of technology included the forecasted revenue growth and an estimated royalty rate. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over its accounting for the acquisition of Finisar. For example, we tested controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the valuation of the customer relationship and technology intangible assets, including management's review of the methods and significant assumptions used to develop such estimates. To test the estimated fair value of the acquired customer relationship and technology intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies used, evaluating the significant assumptions discussed above, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. For the forecasted revenue growth and projected operating expenses inclusive of expected synergies, including future cost savings, and other benefits expected to be achieved by combining the Company and Finisar, we compared the financial projections to current industry and economic trends, the historic financial performance of the acquired business, the Company's history with other acquisitions, and forecasted performance of guideline public companies. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the intangible assets that would result from changes in the significant assumptions. We involved our valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the methodologies used to estimate the fair value of the customer relationship and technology intangible assets and to test certain significant assumptions, including the royalty rate, which included a comparison of the selected royalty rate to a range of royalty rates we identified by performing an independent search of comparable licensing agreements.

Revenue recognition &#8212; identification of contractual terms in certain customer arrangements As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, management assesses relevant contractual terms in its customer arrangements to determine the transaction price and recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of the promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. Management applies judgment in determining the transaction price which is dependent on the contractual terms. In order to determine the transaction price, management may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the identification of contractual terms in customer arrangements to determine the transaction price is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in identifying contractual terms due to the volume and customized nature of the Company's customer arrangements. This in turn led to significant effort in performing our audit procedures which were designed to evaluate whether the contractual terms used in the determination of the transaction price and the timing of revenue recognition were appropriately identified and determined by management and to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including those related to the identification of contractual terms in customer arrangements that impact the determination of the transaction price and revenue recognition.

The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price. Changes in the allocation of the transaction price could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. Considering the nature and volume of school-based book fair transactions, we identified the allocation of the transaction price to the identified performance obligations within school-based book fair contracts as a critical audit matter because the estimation of standalone selling price for the incentive program credits required especially challenging auditor effort and judgment in evaluating the methodology used to establish standalone selling price. Estimating standalone selling price for the incentive program credits utilizes estimates of a standardized value per credit. The standardized value per credit is based on historical experience of issuance and redemption patterns related to the incentive program, adjusted to normalize the data and to align with expectations of future redemptions. Changes in those assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized in the current or future periods. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit &#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's allocation of transaction price to the two performance obligations. We tested management's review controls over the significant assumptions, such as adjustments made to historical experience and redemption patterns, and completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation. To test the allocation of revenue recognized in current and future periods, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used and analyzing the historical experience and redemption patterns, particularly the adjustments made to normalize the data and to align with expectations of future redemptions. We tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying historical incentive credit program data used in management's calculation. To test the accuracy and completeness of historical incentive program issuance and redemption data used in the analysis, we agreed the total incentive program activity to the source system and for a sample of transactions performed transactional testing to source documents. We also evaluated the appropriateness of management's adjustments to historical data by gaining an understanding of the nature of the adjustments, performing a sensitivity analysis and tracing the adjustments to the historical data to source documents.

Reserves for distributor programs - Ship and debit and price protection rights As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, products are sold to distributors at negotiated prices and the distributors are required to pay for the products purchased within the Company's standard commercial terms. Certain distributors may be provided limited rights that allow them to return a portion of inventory and receive credits for changes in selling price (price protection rights) or customer pricing arrangements under the Company's &#8220;ship and debit&#8221; program. Distributor sales account for approximately 44% of total net revenue of $903.9 million for the year ended June 28, 2020 and the associated reserves for ship and debit and price protection rights programs to distributors make up a portion of the accrued contract liabilities account balance of $38.3 million. Under the Company's ship and debit program, subsequent to the initial product purchase, a distributor may request a price allowance for a particular part number(s) for certain target customers, prior to the distributor reselling the particular part to that customer. If the Company approves an allowance and the distributor resells the product to the target customer, the Company credits the distributor according to the allowance the Company approved. Under the price protection rights program, if the Company issues a new price book for its products, the Company will provide a credit to certain distributors for inventory quantities on hand. The credits associated with these programs are applied against the reserve the Company establishes upon initial shipment of product to the distributor. Upon shipment, management uses significant judgment in establishing reserves for the ship and debit and price protection rights programs, which includes developing assumptions related to changes in selling prices. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to reserves for distributor programs - ship and debit and price protection rights is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in estimating the reserves for ship and debit and price protection rights programs, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management's assumption related to changes in selling prices.

Determination of Distinct Performance Obligations in Revenue Contracts Description of the Matter As described in Note 1, the Company enters into contracts with customers that often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Company has generally concluded that software licenses and services are recorded as separate performance obligations and revenue from software licenses and services are recognized as those products and services are provided. Given the nature of the Company's product and service offerings, there is complexity in determining whether software licenses and related services are considered performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or together. Auditing the Company's determination of distinct performance obligations related to its various product and service offerings involved complex auditor judgment. In particular, significant judgment was required when assessing whether the promised products and services are separate performance obligations or inputs to a combined performance obligation due to the evaluation of the interdependency or interrelation of the promised products and services within each contract. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Intuit &#160;Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 54 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Tables of Contents How we Addressed the Matter in Our Audit Our audit procedures related to the determination of distinct performance obligations included the following, among others: &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls, including management review controls, as they relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations.

Specifically, we evaluated whether the performance obligations identified by the Company were capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract through review of the contracts, discussions with management, product demonstrations and review of the Company's website and other marketing materials. More specifically, we evaluated the Company's determination of whether the contract was to deliver (1) multiple promised products or services that constitute separate performance obligations or (2) a single performance obligation that is comprised of the combined products or services promised in the contract. That is, considering the utility, integration, interrelation or interdependence of the products and services, we evaluated whether the multiple promised products and services that were delivered to the customer were outputs or inputs to a combined item.

As discussed in Note 10 of the 2020 consolidated financial statements, goodwill and trademarks and trade names are qualitatively or quantitatively tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when necessary. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Auditing management's annual goodwill and trademarks and trade names impairment tests was complex as considerable management judgment was necessary to estimate fair values of the reporting units and trademarks and trade names. For goodwill, significant assumptions used in management's evaluations included projections of revenue growth rates and profitability, estimated working capital needs and the weighted average cost of capital. For trademarks and trade names, significant assumptions used in management's evaluations included projections of future revenues for the associated brands, royalty rates, and the weighted average cost of capital. The aforementioned assumptions are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions that materially impact the fair value of the reporting units as well as the trademark and trade names. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill and trademark and trade name impairment evaluation process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant assumptions used in the reporting unit and trademark and trade name valuations as well as management's review around the reasonableness of the data used in these valuations. To test the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units and trademarks and trade names, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, testing the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses by comparing to historical and other industry data, as well as validating certain assertions with data internal to the Company and from other sources. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends while also considering changes to the Company's business model, customer base and product mix. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and significant assumptions, such as projections of revenue growth rates and profitability, and estimated working capital needs, by comparing management's past projections to actual performance. We used our valuation specialists to independently compute a range of reasonableness for the weighted average cost of capital. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact that changes in the significant assumptions would have on the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks and trade names. In addition, we tested the reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. We also involved a valuation specialist to assist in our evaluation of the Company's model, valuation methodology and significant assumptions. 58 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Description of the Matter For the year ended June 30, 20 20, the Company's reported net sales from continuing operations was $2.1 billion. As described in Note 2 of the 2020 consolidated financial statements, the Company provides certain retailers and distributors with trade and promotional incentive programs, which results in variable consideration and the Company having to estimate expected levels of promotions that are typically settled in a period after the sale taking place. The estimated costs of these trade promotions and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time a product is sold to the customer. The measurement of trade promotions and sales incentive programs involves the use of judgment related to estimates of expected levels of performance and redemption rates. Auditing the estimate of trade promotions and sales incentives is complex because the revenue recognized is determined based on significant management estimates. In particular, estimates are made for price discounts, slotting fees, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupons. These estimates are based on historical performance of the retailer or distributor, types of promotions, and adjustments for current trends, among other inputs. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the amount of the revenue recognized. The completeness of the trade promotions and sales incentives estimate could also be impacted by any undisclosed side arrangements. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's trade promotions and sales incentives estimation process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant assumptions, such as the historical rate and timing of deductions, management's review of the completeness and accuracy of the data used and other controls such as their retrospective review analysis. Among other tests, we tested the results of the Company's retrospective review analysis of price concessions claimed by distributors and retailers as compared to levels of performance and redemption rates used in the estimate, evaluated the estimates used by comparing them to historical trends, and performed sensitivity analyses over the Company's significant assumptions. We also performed detailed transactional testing of customer deduction data underlying the estimate to validate the nature, timing and amount of deductions taken. Additionally, we obtained confirmations from Company sales representatives in order to assess the completeness of incentive programs.

Revenue Recognition - Identifying and Evaluating Performance Obligations in Certain Customer Contracts in the Network Enablement and Service Enablement Reportable Segments As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had $1,136.3 million of revenue for the year ended June 27, 2020 of which $746.7 million and $102.7 million related to the Network Enablement and Service Enablement segments, respectively. The Company's revenue recognition is determined by management through the following steps: 1) identification of the contract with a customer; 2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognition of revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied. Certain of the Company's contracts with customers include performance obligations consisting of a variety of products and services and may involve a significant level of integration and interdependency between performance obligations. Identifying and evaluating whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations may require significant management judgment, particularly in the Network Enablement and Service Enablement reportable segments due to the nature of the products and service offerings. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - identifying and evaluating performance obligations in certain customer contracts in the Network Enablement and Service Enablement reportable segments is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in identifying and evaluating performance obligations, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to whether such performance obligations were appropriately identified and evaluated by management. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Supplier Incentives As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incentive agreements with many of its suppliers. Supplier rebates can be in the form of instant rebates or achievement-based rebates. Instant rebate programs reduce the Company's inventory cost so that the Company can reduce the ultimate sales price to the customer or provide additional margin to the Company. Achievement-based rebates are earned by achieving certain sales or purchase targets on a periodic basis. We identified supplier incentives as a critical audit matter. We identified supplier incentives as a critical audit matter due to the large volume of transactions subject to rebates that are earned under varying contract terms, and the related estimates made by management. The Company determines whether, among other items, all qualifying sales and purchases are considered in calculating the rebates and cash receipts or credit memos received are appropriately applied. The determination of achievement-based rebates requires management to make estimates about future purchases and sales. For both instant and achievement-based rebates, there is a risk that the rebates are not accounted for consistent with the terms of the current contracts, which requires a high degree of auditor judgment in designing and executing audit procedures to respond to this risk. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our audit procedures related to the supplier incentives included the following, among others. We confirmed a sample of outstanding balances of supplier rebates receivable. For unreturned confirmations, we vouched the related balances to subsequent cash receipts or credit memos received by the Company or obtained the underlying vendor agreements. Using those agreements, we recalculated the receivable based on the stated terms and evaluated the Company's estimates to determine whether the rebate thresholds were met. We verified the completeness and accuracy of the underlying sales or purchases data used by management in determining whether they qualified for rebates during the period. In addition, we analyzed the rebates receivable collection history to evaluate the overall collectability of the supplier rebates receivable balance. We also tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to supplier incentives including, among others, the Company's controls over processing new incentive agreements, specifically related to the appropriate recognition of reductions to cost of goods sold for instant rebates and the appropriate amortization of inventory valuation adjustments to cost of goods sold for achievement-based rebates. Europe Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations Classification in the Absence of an Executed Sales Agreement As described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company classified the product distribution businesses in Europe, the UK (collectively,&#8220;Europe&#8221;), Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and the Miami-based export operations (collectively, &#8220;Latin America&#8221;) as assets held for sale and discontinued operations. As of June 30, 2020, the Company measured these businesses at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $88.9 million, recorded within loss from discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2020. We identified the Europe held for sale treatment as a critical audit matter due to the complexities and judgments involved in making the accounting treatment determination. There are subjective and complex judgments in the following areas: determination of whether the sale of Europe is probable, that the transfer of assets are a completed sale within one year from June 30, 2020, and the determination of an estimated sales price since there is no signed purchase agreement in place as of the date the 10-K was filed. There were also complexities in determining the proper treatment of deferred taxes related to currency translation adjustments previously recorded. Our audit procedures related to held for sale and discontinued operations classification of Europe included the following, among others. We audited management's held for sale evaluation for Europe by comparing the relevant guidance against management's conclusions. We tested the Company's judgments in determining the estimated sales price of Europe based on review of correspondence with potential buyers. We audited management's calculation of the loss on held for sale classification, and the applicable deferred tax impact associated with currency translation adjustments. We evaluated the adequacy of the Company's disclosures on held for sale treatment and discontinued operations against the requirements of the accounting framework and tested the completeness and accuracy of the prior year financial presentation. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls established to identify, authorize and approve, account for and disclose the discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill Valuation As described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, as of June 30, 2020, goodwill recorded in the Worldwide Barcode, Networking and Security reporting unit (&#8220;Barcode&#8221;) was $16.4 million and goodwill recorded in the Worldwide Communications and Services (&#8220;Communications&#8221;) reporting unit was $197.9 million. Goodwill is tested by the Company's management for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level and more frequently when indicators of potential impairment are identified. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, management performed a quantitative impairment test of goodwill. This test resulted in impairment charges of $119.0 million for the Barcode reporting unit. No impairment was recorded in the Communications reporting unit. We identified goodwill valuation as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of goodwill in each reporting unit. Estimates of future performance and market conditions used to arrive at the net present value of future cash flows, which is used within the goodwill impairment analysis, are subjective in nature. In particular, the Company's fair value estimate was sensitive to assumptions including the discount rate and revenue growth rates, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. There were also complexities in determining the allocation of the identified goodwill impairment charges to legal jurisdictions for tax purposes. Our audit procedures related to goodwill valuation include the following, among other procedures. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the Barcode and Communications reporting units which would result from changes in assumptions. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we assessed the Company's methodologies and tested the significant assumptions and underlying data used by the Company in its valuation analysis. With the assistance of our tax specialists, we evaluated whether the allocation of the goodwill impairment for income taxes purposes was appropriate. We evaluated the adequacy of the Company's disclosures on goodwill valuation against the requirements of the accounting framework. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review process.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment As discussed in Notes 1, 4 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, land, buildings and equipment, net and operating right-of-use assets were $6.7 billion as of May 31, 2020. The Company tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount 48 of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Based upon the analyses performed primarily resulting from several coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic factors, including significant reduction in guest traffic at the restaurants, state and local government mandated restrictions including suspension of dine-in operations, and resulting changes in consumer behavior, the Company recognized pre-tax impairment charges for long-lived assets of $51.2 million in fiscal 2020. We identified the evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the effects of expected useful lives of the long-lived assets and the forecasted cash flows to be generated by the asset groups, specifically forecasted sales and forecasted expenses, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting duration of the economic downturn. Furthermore, in determining the fair value of certain long-lived assets, involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assess the market rental rates, rental growth rates and discount rates in certain right-of-use assets. Involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was also required to evaluate certain discount rates used in the impairment models. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's long-lived assets impairment process, including controls related to the assumptions listed above. To test the Company's impairment assessment, we evaluated the Company's ability to accurately forecast future sales and expenses by comparing actual results to the Company's historical forecasts. We performed sensitivity analyses over future sales and expense assumptions and expected useful lives to evaluate the change in the impairment analysis of each asset group resulting from changes in these specific assumptions. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: &#8211; assessing the methodology used to determine the fair value of right-of-use assets; &#8211; evaluating market rental rates in certain right-of-use assets by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities; &#8211; evaluating rental growth rates and discount rates in certain right-of-use assets by comparing them to publicly available market data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting rates; &#8211; assessing the estimate of certain right-of-use assets' fair value considering the application of the Company's rental rates, rental growth rates, and discount rates; and &#8211; evaluating the discount rates by comparing them to publicly available market data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rates. Evaluation of goodwill and trademarks for impairment As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs goodwill and trademarks impairment testing on an annual basis as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs. The Company identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment assessment of goodwill and trademarks at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 upon consideration of the current overall economic conditions resulting from several COVID-19 pandemic factors. Such factors include significant reduction in guest traffic at the restaurants, state and local government mandated restrictions including suspension of dine-in operations, and resulting changes in consumer behavior impacting the Company. The evaluation of goodwill and trademarks impairment requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. A combination of the income and market approach was used to determine the fair value of goodwill and the income approach was used to determine the fair value of trademarks. The goodwill and trademarks balance as of May 31, 2020 was $ 1.0 billion and $805.9 million, respectively. Based upon the analysis performed, the Company recognized pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and trademarks of $314.2 million in fiscal 2020 for Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. We identified the evaluation of goodwill and trademarks impairment analysis as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of auditor judgment required in evaluating certain assumptions used to estimate the fair value of goodwill and trademarks. Specifically, the evaluation of projected sales, operating results, and future cash flows, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting duration of the economic downturn, market multiples, discount rates and royalty rates were subjective to test. Additionally, we involved the use of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's goodwill and trademarks impairment assessment process, including controls related to the 49 assumptions listed above. We compared the Company's historical forecasts of projected sales, operating results, and future cash flows to actual results to evaluate the Company's ability to accurately forecast. We performed sensitivity analyses over forecasts of projected sales, operating results, and future cash flows to assess their impact on the determination of fair value. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: &#8211; assessing the Company's projected sales, operating results, and future cash flows by comparing the projected sales, operating results, and future cash flows in the Company's analyses to industry reports and publicly available market data for comparable entities; &#8211; evaluating the discount rates and market multiples by comparing them to publicly available market data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rates and market multiples; &#8211; performing sensitivity analyses over the discount rates and market multiples to assess their impact on the determination of fair value; and &#8211; evaluating the royalty rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of goodwill triggering events As discussed in Notes 1(i) and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the carrying amount of goodwill as of June 30, 2020 was $1,890 million. The Company performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, might exceed the fair value of the reporting unit. In the current year, the Company performed qualitative, &#160; - 51 - Table of Contents &#160; PART II Item 8 &#160; RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES &#160; or Step 0, assessments to determine whether there was a greater than 50 percent likelihood that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying value. We identified the evaluation of goodwill triggering events as a critical audit matter because such events indicate possible impairment of goodwill, which required the application of greater auditor judgment. Potential triggering events, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, market capitalization and events specific to the entity and reporting units, required a higher degree of auditor judgment to evaluate. These possible triggering events could have a significant effect on the Company's Step 0 assessment and the determination of whether further quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment was required. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included a control related to the Company's assessment of possible goodwill triggering events. We evaluated the Company's Step 0 assessment for its reporting units by: &#61623; Considering macroeconomic indicators such as gross domestic product and inflation by key regions around the world; &#61623; Evaluating information from analyst reports in the enterprise software and sleep and respiratory care industries, which are compared to industry and market considerations used by the Company; and &#61623; Analyzing information including changes in the costs of raw materials and labor, the financial performance of the reporting units, the Company's market capitalization, and other entity and reporting-unit specific events. Evaluation of uncertain tax positions related to Australian Tax Office audits As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's tax filings in Australia for the years 2009 through 2017 are under audit by the Australian Tax Office (ATO). The Company has been assessed $266 million of additional income tax, penalties, and interest for tax years 2009 through 2013 in connection with this tax audit. Certain of these amounts have been paid by the Company to the ATO. However, the Company has not recorded any expense relating to the ongoing audit, or these assessments, as the Company believes it is more likely than not (more than a 50% likelihood) that its tax positions will be upheld. We identified the evaluation of uncertain tax positions related to Australian Tax Office audits as a critical audit matter. This critical audit matter required challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and the subjectivity of the applicable tax rules and regulations. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls over the Australian tax calculation and assessment of uncertain tax positions. We involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge of Australian tax laws, who assisted in: &#61623; Reading formal notices and assessments, and other correspondence received by the Company from the ATO in connection with the audit, as well as responses and information the Company submitted to the ATO in response to its requests for information; &#61623; Evaluating the Company's analysis and conclusions regarding its assertion, which included an assessment of the Company's analysis of Australian tax laws and regulations related to the specific audit findings, and an evaluation of the facts, assumptions, and representations made; and &#61623; Reading legal opinions obtained by the Company from third parties, and inquiring of third-party legal counsel about the likelihood of the Company's tax position being ultimately upheld.

Recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite&#8209;lived intangible assets As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill and indefinite&#8209;lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2020 were $1,401 million and $2,338 million, respectively. Annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment has occurred, the Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite&#8209;lived intangible assets. As a result of recoverability tests performed during the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company recognized goodwill and indefinite&#8209;lived intangible asset impairment charges of $812 million and $614 million, respectively. The Company used a combination of the market and income approaches to determine the estimated fair values of such assets. We identified the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying values of goodwill and trademark indefinite&#8209;lived intangible assets related to the Too Faced, BECCA, and GLAMGLOW reporting units to be a critical audit matter. A high degree of judgment was required of management to estimate the fair value of these reporting units and trademarks. Subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the comparable publicly traded companies used to derive the market multiples and the projected cash flows, including the revenue growth rate, royalty rate, and discount rate assumptions. Additional uncertainty existed in the projected cash flows due to the COVID&#8209;19 pandemic impact on the economic environment. Specialized skills and knowledge were also required to assess the royalty rate and discount rate assumptions. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's goodwill and indefinite&#8209;lived intangible assets impairment process. This included controls over the determination of the assumptions listed above used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units and trademark indefinite&#8209;lived intangible assets. To assess the Company's ability to project cash flows, including revenue growth rates, we compared the Company's historical cash flow projections for Too Faced, BECCA, and GLAMGLOW to actual results. We evaluated the Company's revenue growth rate assumptions by comparing the projections to the underlying business strategies and growth plans. To assess the impact of changes to the assumptions, we performed a sensitivity analysis related to select inputs to the projected cash flows, including revenue growth rates. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: - Developing an estimate of market valuation of the reporting units using an evaluation of comparable publicly traded &#160;companies and market multiples based on publicly available information, and comparing the result to the Company's fair value estimate, - Developing an estimate of fair value of the reporting units using the Company's projected cash flows, including revenue growth rates, and a discount rate based on publicly available information, and comparing the result to the Company's fair value estimate, and - Evaluating the assumed royalty rate for the trademark intangible asset valuation by comparing it to royalty rates for similar companies. F-5 Table of Contents Accounting for income taxes As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income tax in each tax jurisdiction in which it operates. The Company maintains offices in over 50 countries and has key operational facilities located inside and outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse, or distribute goods for sale in approximately 150 countries and territories. We identified the evaluation of the accounting for income taxes as a critical audit matter. The Company's global structure required complex auditor judgment to evaluate the Company's interpretation and application of tax laws in relevant jurisdictions and the income tax impact of the legal entity ownership structure. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's income tax process. This included controls over the identification of changes to tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We obtained an understanding of the Company's overall legal entity structure by reading and evaluating the Company's organizational charts and associated documentation, including legal documents. We, with the assistance of tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, evaluated the effect on the Company's tax provision of changes in its legal entity structure and tax laws by reviewing and evaluating management's tax calculations and assessing the Company's compliance with tax laws. Acquisition&#8209;date fair values of a certain trademark, a certain customer relationship intangible asset, and the previously held equity interest in Have &amp; Be Co. Ltd. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, on December 18, 2019, the Company acquired the remaining 66.66% equity interest in Have&amp;Be Co. Ltd. As a result of the transaction, the Company acquired certain identifiable intangible assets, including trademarks associated with the skincare brands acquired and customer relationships for the acquired company's existing customers. The acquisition&#8209;date fair values for the trademarks and customer relationship intangible assets were approximately $722 million and $937 million, respectively. The Company also re&#8209;measured its previously held equity interest to its acquisition&#8209;date fair value of $660 million and recognized a gain of $534 million, which is included in other income, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. The Company used a combination of the market and income approaches to determine the estimated fair values of such assets and previously held equity interest. We identified the evaluation of the acquisition&#8209;date fair values of a certain trademark, a certain customer relationship intangible asset, and the previously held equity interest in Have&amp;Be Co. Ltd. as a critical audit matter. A high degree of judgment was required of management to estimate of the fair value of these assets. Subjective and complex auditor judgment was required to evaluate the comparable publicly traded companies used to derive the market multiples and the projected cash flows, including the revenue growth rates, royalty rate, and discount rate assumptions, used in estimating the acquisition&#8209;date fair values. Additionally, specialized skills and knowledge were required to assess the royalty rate and discount rate assumptions. F-6 Table of Contents The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's acquisition&#8209;date valuation process. This included controls over the determination of the above listed assumptions used to estimate the acquisition&#8209;date fair values. We evaluated the projected cash flows, including the revenue growth rates, used by the Company by comparing projected cash flows to publicly available information for comparable companies and to historical revenues achieved.

Evaluation of the determination of standalone selling prices of revenue performance obligations for customer contracts with a software license As discussed in Note 2 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generally sells or licenses its software in combination with other products and services such as customer support and professional services. The accounting for customer contracts with a software license requires an allocation of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the determination of the standalone selling price (SSP). SSP for a performance obligation in a customer contract is an &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 115 estimate of the price that would be charged for the specific product or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. This estimate determines the allocation of the transaction price and affects the amount and timing of revenue recognized for each performance obligation in a customer contract. SSP is estimated based on the impact of geographic or regional specific factors, internal costs, profit objectives and pricing practices for different performance obligations. We identified the evaluation of the determination of the SSP of revenue performance obligations for customer contracts with a software license as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the methodology used to establish SSP for each performance obligation which could be offered in a customer contract. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's revenue process, including controls over the methodology used to determine SSP for identified performance obligations in customer contracts which include a software license. We evaluated the methodology used to determine SSP based on current pricing patterns in relevant customer contracts, historical analysis of renewal contract pricing completed by the Company and pricing practices observed in the industry. We inspected a selection of contracts from the SSP population and compared attributes such as price and employee consultant level to historical information. For a sample of software license contracts with multiple performance obligations, we tested that the determined SSP was correctly applied in the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation. Assessment of uncertain tax positions As discussed in Note 2 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recognized uncertain tax positions including associated interest and penalties. The Company's tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities across multiple global subsidiaries and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations. Accordingly, the ultimate outcome with respect to taxes the Company may owe may differ from the amounts recognized. We identified the assessment of uncertain tax positions as a critical audit matter. The assessment of tax exposures and the ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions requires a higher degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the Company's interpretation of, and compliance with, tax law globally across multiple jurisdictions. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's process to assess uncertain tax positions, including controls related to the interpretation of tax law and identification of uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of which of the Company's tax positions may not be sustained upon audit and the estimation of exposures associated with uncertain tax positions. We involved domestic and international tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in assessing filed tax positions and transfer pricing studies, and evaluating the Company's interpretation of tax law and its assessment of certain tax uncertainties and expected outcomes, including, if applicable, the measurement thereof, by reading advice obtained from the Company's external specialists and correspondence with taxation authorities.

Estimate of total contract costs to be incurred for fixed price contract revenue recognized over time As discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, fixed price contract revenue recognized over time for the year ended July 3, 2020 represented 27% of total revenues. For those fixed price contracts recognized over time the Company recognizes revenue based on the ratio of (1) actual contract costs incurred to date to (2) the Company's estimate of total contract costs to be incurred. We identified the evaluation of total contract costs to be incurred for fixed price contract revenue recognized over time as a critical audit matter given the complex nature of the Company's products sold under such contracts. In particular, evaluating the Company's judgments regarding the amount of time to complete the contracts, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's process to develop estimates of total contract costs to be incurred for partially completed performance obligations. Such controls included controls over the estimated amount of time to complete the contracts, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. We considered factors, including the value and stage of completion, to select customer contracts to evaluate the Company's assumptions underlying the estimate of total contract costs to be incurred. We inspected the selected contracts to evaluate the Company's identification of performance obligations and the determined method for measuring contract progress. We compared the Company's original or prior period estimate of total contract costs to be incurred to the actual costs incurred for completed contracts to assess the Company's ability to accurately estimate costs. We inquired of operational personnel of the Company to evaluate progress to date, the estimate of remaining costs to be incurred, and factors impacting the amount of time and cost to complete the selected contracts, including the assessment of the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. We inspected correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customer for the selected contracts as part of our evaluation of contract progress.

The Company also capitalizes certain development costs that relate to internal use software incurred during the application development stage. The Company capitalized $3.0 million and $11.9 million, respectively, of capitalized software development costs and internal use software costs in the year ended June 30, 2020 and had total capitalized software development costs and internal use software costs, net of accumulated amortization, of $12.2 million and $25.7 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2020. Auditing the Company's capitalization of software costs was especially challenging because management's determination of which projects and development activities within those projects qualify for capitalization requires significant judgment, as only those costs incurred in certain stages of software development can be capitalized in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's capitalized software development and internal use software costs processes. This included testing controls over management's determination of which projects and costs qualify for capitalization in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. To test the Company's capitalization of software costs, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, inspecting underlying documentation to evaluate whether the costs were capitalizable under the applicable accounting standards. We also inquired of project managers for significant projects to assess the nature of the costs, the time devoted to capitalizable activities and the underlying documentation.

The write-down of slow moving inventory is recorded for excess or obsolete inventory based on certain inputs and assumptions used to determine the net realizable value. These assumptions include the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received, and the historical sales of inventory to determine recovery rates. Other inputs include current and expected future aviation usage trends, replacement values, expected future demand, and historical scrap recovery rates. We identified the assessment of the write-down of inventories for a portion of the inventory within the Aviation Services segment as a critical audit matter. The primary inputs and assumptions used in determining the write-down of slow moving inventory include the historical recovery rates, which are based on the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received, the historical sales of inventory, and the identification of specific inventories used to service customers no longer under contract. The assessment of these inputs required a higher degree of subjective auditor judgment in evaluating the future customer demand for slow moving inventory. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's inventory process, including controls over the Company's evaluation of the impact on the estimate of net realizable value based on 1) the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received, 2) historical sales of inventory, and 3) specific inventory used to service customers no longer under contract. We also tested relevant information technology application controls over the determination of the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received. We evaluated the write-down to determine that it was recorded using the Company's policy based on the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received, and the recovery rates of existing inventory based on historical sales. We also assessed that the recovery rates applied to slow moving inventory were consistent with historical sales of these inventory items. We determined that the specific inventory items written down were valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on observable market prices. &#160; Evaluation of the key inputs and assumptions used in the estimation of costs at completion of the performance obligations As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time upon the satisfaction of component inventory management and repair services performance obligations based on the cost-to-cost input method, which is based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs at completion of the performance obligation within the Aviation Services segment. The net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments recognized during fiscal year 2020 associated with the Company's component inventory management and repair services totaled $3.9 million, which resulted from changes in the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligations. We identified the evaluation of the key inputs and assumptions used in the estimation of costs at completion of the inventory management and repair services performance obligations for certain contracts within the Aviation Services segment as a critical audit matter. The key inputs and assumptions used in determining the revenue to be recognized include current and future costs to support the program, and future labor costs. The testing of the inputs and assumptions required the application of subjective auditor judgment because of the estimation associated with the inputs and assumptions. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's revenue process, including controls over 1) the assessment of the estimated future costs, 2) actual costs incurred for each performance obligation that are used by the Company in their assessment of the measure of progress, and 3) the approval of costs recorded for each performance obligation to assess the allowability per the contract. We obtained the Company's forecast for the cost of a selection of component inventory management and repair services and assessed that the measure of progress was determined using actual costs to date plus the estimated future costs to support the satisfaction of performance obligations. We selected a sample of contracts to test fiscal year 2020 program costs. We assessed the Company's historical estimates to determine the consistency with the Company's historical projected costs.

Valuation of Inventories As described in Notes&#160;1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated inventories balance was $241.2&#160;million as of June&#160;30, 2020. The Company generally values its inventories at lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. The Company writes down inventory for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on historical usage, orders on hand, assessments of future demands and market conditions, among other items. As disclosed by management, if these factors are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The valuation of inventories requires management to make significant assumptions and complex judgments about the future salability of the inventory and its net realizable value. These assumptions include the assessment of net realizable value by inventory category considering retention periods, future usage and market demand for their products. Additionally, management makes qualitative judgments related to discontinued, slow moving and obsolete inventories. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: &#9679; Testing the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the valuation of inventories, including those related to the Company's methodology for valuing specific inventory categories; &#9679; Testing management's process for determining the valuation of inventories, including: o Evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management including those related to forecasted inventory usage and backlog; o Testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the underlying data used in management's estimate; o Testing the calculations related to the application of the methodology to specific inventory categories; F-3 Table of Contents o Performing inquiries with appropriate non-financial personnel, including sales and production employees, regarding obsolete or discontinued inventory models, cancelled sales orders and other factors to corroborate management's assertions regarding qualitative judgments about discontinued, slow moving and obsolete inventories; and &#9679; Developing an independent expectation of inventory write-downs at&#160;year end based on historical trends and comparing it to management's estimate.

Revenue recognition&#8212;Sales incentive program rebates and discounts Description of the Matter The Company sells its products to original equipment manufacturers, distributors and retailers (collectively, &#8220;customers&#8221;). As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reduces revenue for estimated future reductions to the final selling prices for shipped products including sales incentive programs, such as price protection and volume incentives. Auditing management's estimates of future reductions to the final selling prices is complex as it requires management to make subjective assumptions including the amount of price adjustments on products as well as the timing of its channel sales of products through to end customers. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the completeness of sales incentive programs, the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the calculations and management's assumptions of the amount of future reductions to the final selling prices as well as the timing of its channel sales of products through to end customers. 93 Table of Content s To test the estimated sales incentive programs, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness of sales incentive programs as well as the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the calculations and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management to estimate its reserves related to remaining channel inventory. To test the completeness of the sales incentive programs, we inspected significant new sales contracts and agreements that include the contractual rights to discounts and rebates to validate they are being properly considered in the incentives reserve calculations and examined credit memos issued after year end. We also directly confirmed terms and conditions of agreements with a sample of the Company's customers as well as inquired of sales representatives and other members of management to assess whether all contractual terms were provided to the Finance Department. To test the underlying data used in the sales incentive program reserve calculations, we confirmed ending on hand inventory at a sample of distributors and retailers. To test management's assumptions of the amount of future reductions to the final selling prices as well as the timing of its distributors' sales of products through to end customers we inquired with operations management and compared estimates with industry and analysts' forecasts. In addition, we performed a retrospective review comparing prior period assumptions to the actual results in subsequent periods and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential effect of changes in the Company's significant assumptions. Realizability of deferred income taxes Description of the Matter At July 3, 2020, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $1,566 million, partially offset by a valuation allowance of $438 million. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Auditing the realizability of the deferred tax assets was complex as the assessment process includes forecasting future sources of taxable income and scheduling the use of the applicable deferred tax assets which includes subjective management assumptions, and the amounts involved are material to the financial statements as a whole. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets. This included controls over management's determination of sources and amount of future taxable income including income from operations and scheduling of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. Among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the assumptions used by the Company to develop projections of future taxable income by jurisdiction and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in its projections. For example, we compared the projections of future taxable income with the actual results of prior periods, as well as management's consideration of current industry and economic trends. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management's projections and compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company. In addition, we tested the Company's scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary taxable differences. Accrual for product warranties Description of the Matter At July 3, 2020, the Company's accrual for product warranties was $151 million. As disclosed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company issues various types of product warranties under which the performance of products delivered is generally guaranteed for a specified contractual period. Auditing the Company's product warranty accrual was complex as the calculation of the accrual for product warranties is based on estimates of product failure rates and changes in the estimates can materially affect the accrual recorded in the consolidated financial statements. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process for recording product warranties, including controls over management's review of the estimated failure rates, estimated return rates, and completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the calculation. 94 Table of Content s To test the Company's accrual for product warranties, our audit procedures included, among other procedures, evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated failure rate and estimated return rates and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the calculations. We also performed retrospective reviews of the actual rates to the estimated product failure rates used by the Company and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of changes to the warranty accrual based on changes in product failure rates. This included testing, on a sample basis, the historical product return and current period shipments data used in the warranty accrual calculation, and benchmarking to peer company data.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards with Market Conditions As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock awards with market conditions that vest based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to total shareholder return of a peer group, as measured by the closing prices of the stock of the Company and its peer group for the period as defined in the award agreement, which resulted in the Company recognizing stock-based compensation expense of $4.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. With the assistance of a specialist, management determined the fair value of the performance-based restricted stock awards with market conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to performance-based restricted stock awards with market conditions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management, including the use of a specialist, to determine the fair value of these stock awards using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment to evaluate the audit evidence obtained related to the valuation of the stock awards; and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the performance-based restricted stock awards with market conditions, including management's method and data. These procedures also included, among others, developing an independent estimate of the fair value of a sample of performance-based restricted stock awards with market conditions and comparing to management's estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. The independent estimate was calculated by (i) developing an independent Monte Carlo simulation model of the Company's expected total shareholder return relative to total shareholder return of a peer group as defined in the award agreement and (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of historical stock prices and volatilities of the Company and the peer group data used in the Monte Carlo simulation model by utilizing data obtained from an independent third-party source. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in developing the independent Monte Carlo simulation model and evaluating the audit evidence.

Evaluation of the Accounting for Income Taxes As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded income tax expense related to US and Foreign tax paying jurisdictions totaling $12.83&#160;million for the year ended May&#160;31, 2020, and deferred income tax liabilities totaling $18.13&#160;million at May&#160;31, 2020. The Company's accounting for income taxes involves the application of tax regulations in each of the foreign tax paying jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination of income subject to income tax in each tax paying jurisdiction requires management to apply transfer pricing guidelines for certain intercompany transactions. Additionally, the Company is entitled to claim foreign tax credits for taxes paid in international tax paying jurisdictions. Management's assumptions and allocations used in the determination of the foreign tax credits are based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations and can have a material effect on the calculation of US income taxes. &#160; F-2 We identified the assumptions and allocations used to calculate foreign taxes and international components of US income taxes to be a critical audit matter. These assumptions and allocations include: (i)&#160;interpretation of tax laws in multiple tax paying jurisdictions, (ii)&#160;technical merit of tax positions including considerations related to transfer pricing guidelines for certain intercompany transactions, and (iii)&#160;allocation methodologies that are subjective in nature.

Revenue recognition &#8211; Identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts for the timing of revenue recognition. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management applies the following steps in their determination of revenue to be recognized: 1) identification of the contract with a customer; 2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determination of the transaction price; 4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Since the control of the product is typically transferred to the customer depending on the terms of the contract, management applies judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions when the Company has an enforceable right to payment. For the fiscal year ended June&#160;26, 2020, the Company's revenue was $1,642.0&#160;million. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition, specifically the identification and evaluation of terms and conditions in contracts for the timing of revenue recognition, is a critical audit matter are that there was a significant amount of judgment exercised by management in identifying and evaluating terms and conditions in contracts that impact the timing of revenue recognition. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort in performing our audit procedures to evaluate whether terms and conditions in contracts and point of controls transferred were appropriately identified and evaluated by management.

Valuation of the Projected Benefit Obligation related to the Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP) As described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's projected benefit obligation related to the SERP is $32.2&#160;million as of June&#160;25, 2020. The SERP is an unfunded, non-qualified benefit plan that will provide eligible participants with monthly benefits upon retirement, disability or death, subject to certain conditions. Benefits paid to retirees are based on age at retirement, years of credited service, and average compensation. The most significant assumption related to the Company's SERP is the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Goodwill - Quantitative Impairment Assessment - Exaprint and National Pen Reporting Units As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's goodwill balance was $621.9 million as of June 30, 2020. During March 2020, all of the Company's businesses experienced varying levels of decline in revenue due to the disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although management expects the impacts to be temporary, the negative effects of the pandemic on revenue and profitability triggered an assessment of goodwill, as management expected some of its businesses to achieve materially lower financial results than previously expected. Management's March 31, 2020 goodwill impairment test resulted in impairment charges to the Exaprint reporting unit of $40.4 million, included within The Print Group reportable segment, and the National Pen reporting unit of $34.4 million. Management used the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, to derive the fair value. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The cash flow projections in the fair value analysis are considered Level 3 inputs, and consist of management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration historical results, as well as industry and market conditions. The discount rate used in the fair value analysis is based on a weighted average cost of capital, which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill quantitative impairment assessments for the Exaprint and National Pen reporting units is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the reporting units, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures over the significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rates, operating margins, and discount rates; and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the significant assumptions used in the valuation of the Exaprint and National Pen reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rates, operating margins, and discount rates. Evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rates and operating margins involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the reporting units, the consistency with external market and industry data, and 55 whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company's discounted cash flow model and the reasonableness of the discount rates.

1287032	 PROSPECT CAPITAL CORP		"Critical Audit Matter s The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of Investments As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated investments at fair value were $5,232 million at June 30, 2020. Investments were valued in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement &#32; 119 (&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;), which defines the fair value of investments as the price received upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted. The Company's investment portfolio is primarily comprised of privately held equity and debt instruments, all of which have been determined to be level 3 investments. Per ASC 820, level 3 investments utilize inputs that are unobservable and significant to the entire fair value measurement. The fair value of investments in equity and debt instruments is determined on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors based on input from third-party valuation firms, management and the Audit Committee. The third-party valuation firms prepare independent valuations with a range of values for each investment based on their independent assessments. We identified the valuation of investments as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination are: (i) the number of illiquid investment types in which the Company invests, including portfolio companies, collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLO&#8221;) and real estate properties, (ii) the use of various complex models to value these investments, and (iii) the use of significant unobservable inputs and assumptions in the valuation models. Auditing these complex models and management's assumptions involved a high degree of auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge needed. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: - Evaluating the reasonableness of management's fair value estimates of investments by assessing management's and the third-party valuation firms' assumptions used for each investment type, testing the accuracy and relevance of significant underlying data and validating the mathematical accuracy of the fair value estimates. Significant underlying data testing includes: &#9702; Portfolio companies - (i) assessing the reasonableness and accuracy of underlying data used by obtaining audited, interim and forecasted financial statements from portfolio companies containing revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) amounts, (ii) testing the reasonableness of EBITDA adjustments, (iii) testing the accuracy of the capital structure for control investments and (iv) recalculating the reasonableness of the contractual cash flows associated with non-control investments in accordance with the terms defined in the respective credit agreement. &#9702; CLO - assessing the reasonableness and accuracy of the call date assumption by independently obtaining and verifying historical call dates and recalculating the projected call dates for a sample of investments. &#9702; Real estate properties - assessing the reasonableness and accuracy of property net operating income through confirmations and audited financial statements obtained from underlying property managers. - Utilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in valuation to assist in performing the following procedures for a selection of investments: (i) assessing the appropriateness of valuation models, such as the market or income approach for portfolio companies, including discounted cash flow models for portfolio companies and CLOs or net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) analysis for real estate properties, (ii) evaluating whether assumptions used were reasonable including (a) historical or forecasted revenue or EBITDA multiples, discount rates, and market yields for portfolio companies (b) assumptions such as, but not limited to default rate, prepayment rate, recovery rate, and reinvestment spread for CLOs, and (c) capitalization rates for real estate properties, (iii) recalculating the fair value estimates for accuracy for portfolio companies and real estate properties, and (iv) performing independent fair value calculations for CLOs from independently derived assumptions. CLO Interest Income Recognition The Company's interest income derived from CLOs listed as structured credit securities was $111 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, interest income from investments in the &#8220;equity&#8221; class of securities of CLO funds is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows. For each CLO security, the estimate of future cash flow is generated using third-party cash flow models, modeled with the terms of the CLO and its structure, and assumptions. The estimated future cash flows are used to estimate the effective yield that is applied to determine CLO interest income. Management of the Company monitors the expected cash inflows from the Company's CLO equity investments, including the expected residual payments. The effective yield is determined and updated quarterly. 120 We identified CLO interest income recognition as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination are the high degree of subjectivity and complexity in management's judgments relating to the various assumptions used in the future cash flow models, which are then used to allocate interest income to the &#8220;equity&#8221; class of the CLO. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. &#160; The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: - On a sample basis, testing CLO interest income through: (i) recalculating management's accretable yield and resulting income from respective cash flow runs, and (ii) testing of management's assumptions by recalculating and independently corroborating management provided inputs and outputs for significant assumptions, including but not limited to call dates, CLO manager specific default rate, prepayment rate, recovery rate and reinvestment term, in accordance with management's policy, to external sources and confirmations received directly from the underlying collateral managers. - On a sample basis, evaluating the reasonableness of CLO projected cash flows against actual cash collections, where applicable. Evaluating significant variances, if any, to determine whether the methodology and assumptions utilized were appropriate. - Utilizing personnel with specialized skill and knowledge in valuation to assist in evaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of management's significant assumptions used to estimate projected future cash flows from CLOs, including but not limited to default rate, discount rate, prepayment rate, recovery rate, and reinvestment term and spread.

The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Allowance for loan and lease losses As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company has a gross loan and lease portfolio of $10.7 billion and related allowance for loan and lease losses of $75.8 million as of June 30, 2020. The Company's allowance for loan and lease losses is a material and complex estimate requiring significant management judgment in the evaluation of the credit quality and the estimation of inherent losses within the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance for loan and lease losses includes a general reserve that is determined based on the results of a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of all loans not measured for impairment at the reporting date. We identified the qualitative estimation of losses within the allowance for loan and lease losses as a critical audit matter. In calculating the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Company considers relevant credit quality indicators for each loan and F-1 lease segment, stratifies loans and leases by risk characteristic, and estimates losses for each loan and lease type based upon their nature and risk profile. The estimation of losses inherent within the portfolio requires significant management judgment, particularly where the Company has not incurred sufficient historical losses and has utilized observable peer data in forming its qualitative loss estimate within its calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions involves especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: - Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to management's review of the reasonableness of assumptions and sources of data, and appropriateness of inputs and factors used by management in forming its qualitative loss estimate. - Evaluating whether changes in the business or industry, including economic volatility resulting from the current global pandemic, necessitate the consideration of other factors in the calculation of the qualitative loss estimate. - Evaluating the reasonableness of inputs, factors and sources of data used by management in forming its qualitative loss estimate, including the use of peer data in instances where the Company did not have sufficient historical loss data, by performing retrospective review of historic loan and lease loss experience and analyzing historical data used in developing the assumptions to consider whether such inputs, factors and sources of data were relevant, reliable, and reasonable for the purpose used. - Evaluating whether the assumptions used in the determination of the qualitative loss estimate are consistent with the supporting data, relevant historical data, and industry data. - Testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations used by management in the determination of its qualitative loss estimate.

Revenue Recognition Description of the Matter As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's contracts with customers sometimes contain multiple performance obligations, which are accounted for separately if they are distinct. In such cases, the transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis, and revenue is recognized when control of the distinct performance obligation is transferred. For example, product revenue is recognized at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license, and subscription and support revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. Auditing the Company's revenue recognition was complex, including the identification and determination of distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition. For example, there were nonstandard terms and conditions that required judgment to determine the distinct performance obligations and the impact on the timing of revenue recognition. - 55 - Table of Contents How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's process and controls to identify and determine the distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition. To test the identification and determination of the distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition, our audit procedures included, among others, reading the executed contract and purchase order to understand the contract, identifying the performance obligation(s), determining the distinct performance obligations, and evaluating the timing of revenue recognition for a sample of individual sales transactions. We evaluated the accuracy of the Company's contract summary documentation, specifically related to the identification and determination of distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition. Business Combinations Description of the Matter As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed an acquisition of CloudGenix, Inc. for net consideration of $402.7 million in the year ended July 31, 2020. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination. Auditing the accounting for the acquisition was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair values of identified intangible assets, which consisted of developed technology of $67.2 million and customer relationships of $42.7 million. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to underlying assumptions about future performance of the acquired business and due to the limited historical data on which to base these assumptions. The significant assumptions used to form the basis of the forecasted results included revenue growth rates and technology migration curves. These significant assumptions were forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over its accounting for the acquisition. This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and measurement of identified intangible assets, and management's judgment and evaluation of underlying assumptions and estimates with regards to the fair values of the identified intangible assets. To test the estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, reading the underlying agreements, testing management's application of the relevant accounting guidance, and involving a specialist to assist us in the evaluation of the Company's valuation methodology and testing of the significant assumptions. For example, we compared the revenue growth rates and technology migration curves to current industry, market and economic trends. Additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. Convertible Notes Description of the Matter As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company issued $2.0 billion of convertible senior notes due in 2025 (Convertible Notes) in the year ended July 31, 2020. The accounting for the transaction was complex, as it required assessment as to whether features, other than the conversion feature, required bifurcation and separate valuation. Additionally, the transaction was complex as it required valuation of the conversion feature in the debt instrument, which involved estimation of the fair value of the debt instrument absent of any conversion feature, and evaluation of the appropriate classification of the conversion feature in the financial statements. Auditing the Company's accounting for the Convertible Notes was complex due to the significant judgment required in determining the liability component of the Convertible Notes as well as the balance sheet classification of the elements of the Convertible Notes. The Company estimated the fair value of the liability component of the Convertible Notes, absent any embedded conversion features, using an income approach which considers the instrument's discounted cash flow model with a risk adjusted yield. Additionally, the Company performed a detailed analysis of the terms of the Convertible Notes to identify whether any derivatives that required separate mark-to-market accounting under applicable accounting guidance were present. - 56 - Table of Contents How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's Convertible Notes. For example, we tested the Company's controls over the initial recognition and measurement of the Convertible Notes, including the recording of the associated liability and equity components. We also tested the evaluation of the Convertible Notes and the identification and evaluation of specific features and the related accounting. To test the accounting for the Convertible Notes, our audit procedures included, among others, reading the underlying Convertible Notes agreements, testing management's application of the relevant accounting guidance, and involving a specialist to assist us in the evaluation of the Company's valuation methodology and testing of the significant assumptions. Our testing of the fair value of the liability component, included, among other procedures, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology and significant assumptions used by the Company, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. Specifically, when assessing the key assumptions, we evaluated the appropriateness of the Company's estimates of its credit risk, volatility, dividend yield and the market risk free rate as well as its analysis of comparable issuances of debt securities by companies with a similar credit risk rating.

Unrecognized tax benefits As discussed in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if there is more than a 50% likelihood that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. As of June 30, 2020, the Company has recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest and penalties, of $31.4 million. We identified the assessment of gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment on an annual basis, or whenever impairment indicators exist. During Fiscal 2020, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $171 million associated with two of its Jimmy Choo reporting units. The Company also recognized an impairment charge of $180 million associated with the Jimmy Choo indefinite-lived brand name intangible asset. Auditing the Company's annual impairment assessments was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of indefinite-lived brand name intangible assets. In particular, the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions, such as changes in the discount rate, revenue growth rate, margin and royalty rates, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions (including the effects of the global pandemic). How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment review process, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above. To test the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the valuation methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends and evaluated whether changes to the Company's business environment would affect the significant assumptions. For example, we compared the royalty rates used in estimating the fair value of certain indefinite-lived brand name intangible assets to current industry licensing agreements. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived brand name intangible assets that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved our internal valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the significant assumptions and methodologies used by the Company in developing the fair value estimates. In addition, we tested management's reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. Adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases Description of the Matter As discussed above and in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (&#8220;ASC 842&#8221;) on March 31, 2019. As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded a lease liability and related right of use asset of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively on its balance sheet at March 28, 2020. Auditing management's initial recognition of the lease liabilities and right-of-use asset upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 was especially challenging due to the volume and diversity of leases in the Company's global lease portfolio. Further, the Company's estimated incremental borrowing rate had a significant effect on the measurement of the lease liability and right-of use asset recognized upon adoption. Auditing management's calculated incremental borrowing rate was complex due to the judgement involved in developing the expected interest rates for secured borrowings based on the term and the economic environment of the leases. 65 Table of Contents How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 included testing of controls over management's review of the completeness of the lease population and the calculation of the incremental borrowing rate. We tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the Company's initial recognition of the lease liabilities and right-of-use asset. Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing the information in a sample of lease agreements to the Company's analyses and selecting leases from independent sources and assessing their inclusion in the Company's analysis. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the key assumptions and methodologies management used to develop the incremental borrowing rate. We independently calculated a range of incremental borrowing rates and compared it to the rates used by the Company. Impairment of Retail Store Long-Lived assets Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets, which primarily include property, plant, and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets at retail stores, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended March 28, 2020, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $357 million related to the long-lived assets at certain of its retail stores. In addition, upon adoption of ASC 842, Leases, the Company recorded a $152 million impairment, net of tax, of operating lease assets at certain of its retail stores as a reduction to retained earnings on March 31, 2019. Auditing the Company's impairment assessment of retail store long-lived assets was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the future cash flows used to assess recoverability of each retail store long-lived asset group (undiscounted) and determining the fair value (discounted). The significant assumptions used include estimated future cash flows directly related to the future operation of the stores (including sales and expense growth rates) and the discount rate used to determine fair value. Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain operating lease right-of-use assets include the current market rent and discount rate for the remaining lease term of the related stores. These assumptions are subjective in nature and are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions (including the effects of the global pandemic). How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the retail store long-lived assets impairment process, including, determining the undiscounted future cash flows of the stores and the fair value of the long-lived assets (including those related to operating leases) for the stores that were deemed to be impaired. We also tested controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above. Our testing of the Company's impairment measurement included, among other procedures, evaluating the significant assumptions and operating data used to calculate the estimated future cash flows and to determine the fair value of the store long lived asset groups. For a sample of retail stores, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used by the Company in its analyses and we compared the significant assumptions used to determine the forecasted cash flows to historical results of the retail stores, current industry and economic trends and inquired of the Company's executives to understand the business initiatives supporting the assumptions in the future cash flows. We involved our internal valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the fair value of certain operating lease right-of-use assets, which included assessing the estimated market rental rates of these leases by comparing them to rental rates for comparable leases and evaluating the applied discount rate.

Evaluation of certain sales incentives and trade promotion allowances As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and trade promotion allowances through various programs. The Company records accruals based on sales incentive agreements and expectations 43 Table of Contents regarding customer participation and performance levels. Customer participation and performance levels are primarily based on historical sales and redemption rates, current customer sales, and industry trends. &#160; We identified the evaluation of certain accruals for sales incentive and trade promotion allowances as a critical audit matter. Subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive will be claimed by the end consumer, coupled with customer participation expectations. This specifically related to the impact of historical sales, payments, and redemption rates on the Company's accrual. &#160; The primary procedures that we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's sales incentive and trade promotion allowance process, including the accrual methodology, and evaluation of the use of historic data. To evaluate the Company's accrual for certain sales incentives and trade promotions allowances we (1) assessed the Company's ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, (2) evaluated conditions in the current operating environment which may affect the use of historical sales, payments, and redemption rates as inputs to the projected accrual, (3) evaluated a sample of customer and end consumer incentive payments, which are the basis for certain portions of the Company's accrual for sales incentives and trade promotions, based on volumes sold and the terms of the sales incentives to validate the accuracy of the payment made and the lag time between product invoice and incentive redemption, and (4) evaluated certain customer and end consumer incentive accruals based on volumes sold, historic payments, and the terms of the sales incentives to test the basis of the specific customer's projected accrual. Incremental audit procedures over IT financial reporting processes As of May 26, 2019 the Company identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access over one of the Company's information technology (IT) systems that support the Company's financial reporting processes. Automated and manual business process controls that were dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. During a portion of the 53-week period ended May 31, 2020, the ITGCs were ineffective and the information or system generated reports produced by the affected financial reporting systems could not be relied upon without further testing. &#160; We identified the design and evaluation of the sufficiency of the incremental audit procedures over the financial information reliant on the impacted IT systems as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment was required to design incremental audit procedures and assess the sufficiency of the procedures performed and evidence obtained due to ineffective controls and the complexity of the Company's IT environment. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We used our judgment to determine the nature and extent of incremental audit procedures to be performed over the information produced by the impacted IT systems. We modified the types of procedures that were performed, which included testing the underlying records of selected transaction data obtained from the impacted IT systems to support the use of the information in the conduct of the audit. In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to the information produced by the impacted IT systems.

Impairment Assessment of Stream and Royalty Interests in Mineral Properties Description of the Matter At June 30, 2020, the Company's stream and royalty interest balance totaled $2.3 billion. As more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates its stream and royalty interests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the asset or group of assets may not be recoverable (&#8220;triggering events&#8221;). Management evaluates various qualitative factors in determining whether or not events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The factors considered include, among others, significant changes in estimates of forecasted gold, silver, copper and other metal prices, significant changes in operators' estimates of proven and probable reserves and other relevant information received from the operators, which 41 Table of Contents may include operational or legal information that indicates production from mineral interests will not likely occur or may be significantly reduced in the future. &#160; Auditing the Company's impairment assessment involved our subjective judgment because, in determining whether a triggering event occurred, management uses estimates that include, among others, assumptions about forecasted gold, silver, copper and other metal prices and total future production using reserve or other relevant information reported by the operators. Significant uncertainty exists with these assumptions. Further, management's evaluation of any new information indicating that production will not likely occur or may be significantly reduced in the future requires significant judgment. &#160; How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process over the impairment assessment. For example, we tested controls over the Company's process for identifying and evaluating potential impairment triggers and related significant assumptions and judgments. To test the Company's impairment assessment, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions, judgments and operating data used in the Company's analysis. Specifically, we compared forecasted gold, silver, copper and other metal prices to available market information, and we corroborated reserve information to available operator or publicly available information. We involved our specialist and searched for and evaluated other publicly available information that corroborates or contradicts the reserve estimates or indicates that production from mineral interests will not likely occur or may be significantly reduced in the future. We also considered the professional qualifications and objectivity of management's specialists and the reputation of the third-party operators. Further, we evaluated the reasonableness of changes to estimated proven and probable reserves using our experience with the Company's stream and royalty interests and industry knowledge.

Capitalized internal-use software development costs As discussed in Notes 2(g) and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company capitalizes certain internal-use software costs related to new products as well as existing products when those costs will result in significant additional functionality. The Company's capitalized internal-use software asset, net of accumulated amortization, was $37 million as of June 30, 2020. The Company capitalized $28 million of internal-use software costs during the year ended June 30, 2020. We identified the determination of capitalized internal-use software development costs as a critical audit matter because of the degree of subjectivity involved in assessing which projects met the capitalization criteria. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control related to the critical audit matter. This control related to the determination of which software development projects met the capitalization criteria. For a selection of current year capitalized software costs, we evaluated the Company's determination to capitalize the costs by reading the Company's analysis and discussing the objective and status of the projects with IT department management. We also assessed a F-3 Table of Contents sample of the Company's capitalized costs by confirming the nature of the activities performed with individual software developers.

The computation of Managed Public Schools revenue generated from state sources is based upon the amount of eligible funding expected to be provided by the state where the public school or school district is located. Total eligible funding from all sources represents the maximum value to be recognized for Managed Public School revenues and is adjusted as necessary for individual school financial deficits and surpluses. &#160; We identified management's judgments related to Managed Public Schools revenues as a critical audit matter. The critical input used to calculate state eligible funding is enrollment, which is defined by the state governing authorities, varies by school and by funding metric, and often requires management to perform complex calculations including the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Assumptions and inputs used to determine enrollment figures may include withdrawal rates, new registrations, average daily attendance, special needs enrollment, student demographics, academic progress, historical completion rate, and student location among others. Changes to these inputs and assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of expected annual funding, and thus revenues recognized. Auditing enrollment figures involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to properly address inputs within the enrollment calculations tested. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: &#9679; Testing the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to the determination of enrollment figures including the monthly review of projected student counts and review of schools' funding calculations. These controls include review of the reasonableness of assumptions used and the appropriateness of methodologies used to determine enrollment figures pursuant to the Company's interpretation of the states' enrollment definitions. &#9679; Testing the completeness, existence, and accuracy of enrollment calculations by validating a sample of underlying student data and assumptions used as inputs through the inspection of relevant source documents including admission records, evidence of access to the learning platforms, course activity reports, and third-party support. &#9679; Testing the Company's computations of enrollment figures and state eligible funding for a sample of schools through recalculating the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. &#9679; Performing a retrospective review of funding on a school by school basis and investigating variances outside of predetermined thresholds through the inspection of relevant source documents.

OCL was purchased for net consideration of $118 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, which resulted in a $26 million customer relationships intangible asset being recorded. As disclosed by management, a multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach was used to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset. The significant assumptions utilized in calculating the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset were the discount rate and the terminal growth rate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the acquisition of OnCourse Learning LLC &#8211; valuation of customer relationships is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the discount rate and the terminal growth rate used in the fair value estimate of the customer relationships intangible asset. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. 76 Table of Contents Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of control over management's valuation of the customer relationships intangible asset.

Revenue recognition includes management estimates of uptick fee variable consideration for Search engagements and estimates of the total hours at completion used to recognize revenue as services are rendered under Consulting contracts. &#160; Auditing revenue recognition was complex due to the volume of transactions within the various revenue streams with each revenue stream representing a different pattern of revenue recognition. Auditing revenue recognition also incorporates testing the underlying data supporting management estimates mentioned above that are used in recognizing revenues under Search and Consulting contracts. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit &#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's processes&#160;and controls related to the recognition of each revenue stream, including, among others, controls over management review of contractual terms, management's determination of when control of goods and services are transferred to customers&#160;&#160;as well as management's review of the accuracy and completeness of underlying data used in the estimates mentioned above. &#160; Our audit procedures included, among others, testing a sample of contracts to determine whether terms that may affect revenue recognition were identified and properly considered, performance obligations were appropriately identified in the Company's evaluation of the accounting for the contracts and revenue was recognized when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. In addition, we tested management estimates mentioned above. For Search contracts, we compared the estimates of uptick fee revenues to historical actual data for a portfolio of similar contracts. For Consulting contracts, we compared the data used in the estimate of the total hours at completion to time reports for work completed to date, recalculated the percentage of completion and assessed the reasonableness of management's estimates to complete based on an understanding of the current status of the contracts. We also performed analysis over contracts completed during the year to determine whether there are significant changes in the estimate from initiation to completion of contracts. &#160; &#160; Goodwill - Consulting Reporting Unit Description of the Matter &#160; At April 30, 2020, the goodwill recorded in the Consulting reporting unit was $173 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested by the Company's management for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level and more frequently when indicators of potential impairment are identified. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, management performed a quantitative impairment test of goodwill due to the identification of potential COVID-19 related impairment indicators. &#160; Auditing the Company's annual goodwill impairment test was complex due to the significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the reporting units when the fair value is at or near carrying value. In particular, the Consulting reporting unit's fair value estimate was sensitive to assumptions including the discount rate and revenue growth rates which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. &#160; How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit &#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review process. This includes controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above. &#160; To test the estimated fair value of the Company's Consulting reporting unit, we performed audit procedures with the assistance of our valuation specialists that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the Consulting reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. &#160; "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56679/000156459020032398

The U.S. pension plans' net periodic benefit cost for the year ended May 31, 2020 was $950 million.&#160;&#160;As explained in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain U.S. employees. The Company's U.S. pension plans' projected benefit obligations are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management's assumptions for discount rate, salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. Auditing the U.S. pension plans' projected benefit obligation was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the discount rate used in the measurement process. The discount rate is developed by utilizing the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds that match cash flows to benefit payments, limit the concentration by industry and issuer, and apply screening criteria to exclude bonds with a call feature unless they have a low probability of being called. The discount rate had a significant effect on the pension projected benefit obligation. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit &#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's process for estimating the pension plans' projected benefit obligation, including management's review of the significant assumptions and assessment of the data inputs provided to the actuary. To test the U.S. pension plans' projected benefit obligation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions described above, and the underlying data used by the Company. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends and evaluated the change in the pension plans' projected benefit obligation from the prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating management's methodology for determining the discount rate. As part of this assessment, we compared management's selected discount rate to an independently developed range of reasonable discount rates. Additionally, we compared the pension plans' projected future cash flows to the prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to management's actuarial specialists. - 104 - &#160; &#160; &#160; Valuation of Self-Insurance Accruals Description of the Matter &#160; At May 31, 2020, the Company's self-insurance accruals reflected in the balance sheet were $3.3 billion. As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, self-insurance accruals include costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and disability programs. These accrued liabilities are primarily based on the actuarial estimation of the cost of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims. Auditing the Company's self-insurance accruals is complex and required us to use our actuarial specialists due to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate, the application of management judgment, and the use of various actuarial methods. In addition, the accruals are sensitive due to the volume of claims and the amount of time that can pass before the final cost is known. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit &#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process of estimating self-insurance accruals, including management's review of the assumptions used, results of calculations and assessment of data underlying the accruals. To evaluate the self-insurance accruals, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data used by the Company. We involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodologies applied by management in determining the actuarially determined accrual and in reviewing the Company's reinsurance contracts by policy year to assess the Company's self-insured retentions, deductibles, and coverage limits. We compared the Company's accrued amounts to a range developed by our actuarial specialists. &#160; &#160; "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048911/000156459020032775

Evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's goodwill was $11.44 billion as of May 31, 2020.&#160;&#160;Annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential asset impairment has occurred, the Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill.&#160;&#160;The Company performed a quantitative impairment test of goodwill during its first fiscal quarter in connection with a reorganization of its segments. In the fourth fiscal quarter, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for its required annual goodwill impairment evaluation. The results of the quantitative impairment test indicated that all but three reporting units had an estimated fair value substantially in excess of the carrying value. The aggregate goodwill in the three reporting units where the fair value was not substantially in excess of the carrying value was $3.49 billion.&#160;&#160;For the qualitative assessment in the fourth fiscal quarter, the Company determined for all the reporting units, that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair value was less than the carrying values.&#160;&#160; We identified the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill as a critical audit matter.&#160;&#160;Subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain assumptions and information used in the Company's first fiscal quarter quantitative impairment test and its fourth fiscal quarter qualitative impairment assessment for the three reporting units where the fair value was not substantially in excess of the carrying value.&#160;&#160;Specifically, for the quantitative impairment test, these assumptions included forecasted revenue growth rates including the terminal growth rates, and margin growth rates used in determining the forecasted cash flows and the selection of discount rates.&#160;&#160;For the qualitative impairment assessment for the three reporting units, the information included evaluating the industry, macroeconomic and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events affecting the reporting units.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following.&#160;&#160;We tested certain internal controls over the Company's evaluation of the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting units, as well as the controls over the Company's annual qualitative impairment assessment. We evaluated the Company's ability to forecast cash flows by comparing historical forecasts to actual results and forecasted cash flows with the Company's most recent plans. We also considered current industry, macroeconomic and market conditions, the Company's historical results and the results of other guideline companies within the same industry in evaluating the assumptions described above.&#160;&#160; We evaluated the Company's qualitative impairment assessment by considering any event specific changes to the reporting units, analyst industry reports, and the Company's latest available forecasted financial information.&#160;&#160; We involved our valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: &#160; - evaluating the discount rates used by the Company by comparing the Company's inputs to the discount rates to publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rate&#59; &#160; - evaluating the terminal growth rates by comparing them with publicly available market data&#59; and &#160; - testing the estimate of the fair value of the reporting units using the Company's cash flow assumptions and discount rates and comparing the results to the Company's fair value estimate. Evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets&#160;&#160; As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets (consisting primarily of brand names and trademarks) were $3.40 billion as of May 31, 2020.&#160;&#160;For the year ended May 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $165.5 million on indefinite-lived intangible assets.&#160;&#160;In assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment , the Company performs either a qualitative or quantitative 99 &#160; assessment at least annually or whenever circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists.&#160;&#160;When a quantitative assessment is performed, the Company estimates the fair value of the intangibles by utilizing a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate that would be charged to a third party for the use of the brand.&#160;&#160; Impairment charges are recorded for any intangibles with carrying values in excess of the estimated fair values.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We identified the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets for which a quantitative impairment assessment is performed as a critical audit matter.&#160;&#160;Subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain assumptions used in determining the fair value of these assets.&#160;&#160;Specifically, there was a high degree of judgment required in evaluating assumptions related to the forecasted revenue growth rates including the terminal growth rates and forecasted margins, royalty rates and discount rates. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following.&#160;&#160;We tested certain internal controls over the quantitative impairment assessments, including controls over the development of the assumptions described above.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. &#160; Valuation of Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowances for Implicit Price Concessions &#160; As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, net service revenue is recognized at the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing services directly to consumers. Amounts collected may be less than amounts billed due to implicit price concessions, resulting from client eligibility issues, insufficient or incomplete documentation, services at levels other than authorized, pricing differences and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. Management estimates the value of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions, based upon historical experience and other factors, including an aging of accounts receivable, evaluation of expected adjustments, past adjustments and collection experience in relation to amounts billed, current contract and reimbursement terms, shifts in payors and other relevant information. As disclosed by management, the evaluation of these historical and other factors involves complex, subjective judgments. Accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions (before the allowance for bad debt), were $150.7 million as of December 31, 2019. &#160; The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management to determine the estimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to the valuation of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions. As described in the &#8220;Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting&#8221; section, a material weakness was identified related to the lack of design and maintenance of controls over the accuracy of the implicit price concession assumption used in the estimation of the recoverability of unadjudicated net service revenues (accounts receivable, net). &#160; Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) evaluating management's process for developing the estimate of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions, as well as the relevance and use of historical experience data as an input into the estimate, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the charges and payments used by management in the estimate by testing a sample of revenue transactions, (iii) evaluating the historical accuracy of management's process for developing the estimate of the amount which will ultimately be collected by comparing actual cash collections to the F-3 Table of Contents &#160; previously recorded accounts receivable, and (iv) developing an independent expectation of the amount expected to be collected by management. Developing the independent expectation involved calculating the percentage of cash collections as compared to the recorded accounts receivable balance as of the end of the prior year and comparing that percentage to management's collection expectation used to determine the current year estimate of accounts receivable, net of allowances for implicit price concessions. &#160; Valuation of Hospice Partners of America, LLC and VIP Health Care Services Identifiable Intangible Assets &#160; As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2019, the Company completed the acquisitions of Hospice Partners of America, LLC (&#8220;Hospice Partners&#8221;) and all of the assets of VIP Health Care Services (&#8220;VIP&#8221;) for net consideration of $135.6 million and $29.9 million, respectively. As a result of these acquisitions, management recorded identifiable intangible assets related to trade names, non-competition agreements, state licenses, and customer and referral relationships in the aggregate amount of $33.5 million. Management estimates the fair values of the trade names using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions such as the long-term growth rates of future revenues, the relief from royalty rate for such revenue, the tax rate and the discount rate. Management estimates the fair value of existing indefinite-lived state licenses based on a blended approach of the replacement cost method and cost savings method, which involves estimating the total process costs and opportunity costs to obtain a license, by estimating future earnings before interest and taxes and applying an estimated discount rate, tax rate and time to obtain the license. Management estimates the fair value of existing finite-lived state licenses based on a method of analyzing the definite revenue streams with the license and without the license, which involves estimating revenues and expenses, estimated time to build up to a current revenue base, which is market specific, and the non-licensed revenue allocation, revenue growth rates, discount rate and tax amortization benefits. Management estimates the fair value of customer and referral relationships based on a multi-period excess earnings method, which involves identifying revenue streams associated with the assets, estimating the attrition rates based upon historical financial data, expenses and cash flows associated with the assets, contributory asset charges, rates of return for specific assets, growth rates, discount rate and tax amortization benefits. Management estimates the fair value of non-competition agreements based on a method of analyzing the factors to compete and factors not to compete, which involves estimating historical financial data, forecasted financial statements, growth rates, tax amortization benefit, discount rate, review of factors to compete and factors not to compete as well as an assessment of the probability of successful competition for each non-competition agreement. &#160; The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of identifiable intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of Hospice Partners and VIP is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of identifiable intangible assets acquired due to the significant amount of judgment by management when developing the estimates&#59; (ii) significant audit effort was necessary in evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates, such as (a) the relief from royalty rate and the discount rate for certain trade names, (b) the estimated time to obtain the license and the discount rate for certain indefinite-lived state licenses, (c) the estimated time to build up to a current revenue base, non-licensed revenue allocation, revenue growth rates, and the discount rate for the finite-lived state licenses, (d) the discount rate for the customer and referral relationships, and (e) the discount rate for one non-competition agreement (collectively, the &#8220;identifiable intangible assets significant assumptions&#8221;)&#59; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. &#160; Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets recorded from the VIP and Hospice Partners acquisitions, including controls over development of the identifiable intangible assets significant assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the fair value of intangible assets, which included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of identifiable intangible assets significant assumptions. Evaluating the reasonableness of the identifiable intangible assets significant assumptions, except for the discount rates, involved considering the following, as applicable, (i) past performance of the acquired businesses, and (ii) economic and industry metrics and forecasts. In addition, the discount rates were evaluated by considering the cost of capital of comparable businesses and other industry factors. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods used and the reasonableness of the discount rates. &#160; &#160; &#160; "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000156459020038909

For the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of $4.4 billion as disclosed in Note 16. 59 &#160; &#160; &#160; Auditing management's assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets involved subjective estimation and complex auditor judgment in determining whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to support the realization of the existing deferred tax assets. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit &#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls over management's estimates of future taxable income. Among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the significant assumptions used by the Company to develop estimated future taxable income and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we evaluated management's estimates of future taxable income by performing a look-back analysis of management's historical estimates compared to actual results as well as compared management's estimates to current industry and economic trends. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of future taxable income to evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets resulting from changes in assumptions. &#160; &#160; Program rights amortization &#8211; National sports programming Description of the Matter &#160; As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has programming rights, including single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of sports events. The costs of multi-year sports contracts at the Company are primarily amortized based on the ratio of each current period's attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each contract. Auditing the amortization of the Company's national sports programming involved subjective estimation and complex auditor judgment because the analysis that the Company relies upon to determine the amortization of this programming is based on estimates of future revenues from the programming. Differing estimates of future revenues could materially affect the timing of sports programming amortization. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit &#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the amortization of the Company's national sports programming, including controls over management's review of the analysis and the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated future revenues. We also tested management's controls to validate that the data used in the analysis was complete and accurate. Among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the significant assumptions used by the Company to develop the estimated future revenues and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the analysis. For example, we evaluated management's forecasts of estimated future revenues by performing a look-back analysis of management's historical estimates compared to actual results. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the estimated future revenues to evaluate the change in the amortization of the Company's national sports programming resulting from changes in the assumptions.

As discussed in Note 5 of the financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment require the performance of an interim impairment assessment. Auditing management's impairment tests was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting units for goodwill. Specifically, the fair value estimates for goodwill were sensitive to significant assumptions including the estimation of expected cash flows, discount rates, and residual growth rates. The fair value estimates of goodwill are affected by such factors as industry performance, market saturation and opportunity, changes in technology and operating cash flows. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company recorded goodwill impairments of approximately $82.0 million. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review processes. For example, we tested controls over the quantitative impairment analyses of goodwill, including the valuation models and underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates. To test the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's valuation methodology used, evaluating the prospective financial information utilized in the valuations, and involving our valuation specialists to assist in testing certain significant assumptions described above, such as discount rates and residual growth rates. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. Measurement of molecular diagnostic testing revenue Description of the Matter During the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company's molecular diagnostic testing revenue was $586.9 million. As discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements, molecular diagnostic testing revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is complete. Auditing the measurement of the Company's molecular diagnostic testing revenue was complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required in estimating the amount that will be collected for each test. In particular, the estimate of revenue is affected by assumptions in payor behavior such as changes in payor mix, payor collections, current customer contractual requirements, and experience with ultimate collection from third-party payors. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's revenue recognition process. As part of our testing, we considered controls over management's review of the significant assumptions above and inputs used in calculating the estimated amount that would be collected for each test and tested management's controls to compare actual payments received to previously forecasted activity. We also tested controls used by management to compare the current and historical data used in making the estimates for completeness and accuracy. Our audit procedures over the Company's molecular diagnostic testing revenue included, among others, assessing valuation methodologies and models and testing the significant assumptions above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We agreed transactions selected for testing back to the actual customer contract terms. We compared the significant assumptions above and inputs used by management to changes in the Company's contracted rates, third-party payor collection trends, and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of the cash collections used in the Company's revenue models and assessed the completeness of adjustments to estimates of future cash collections as a result of significant contract amendments, changes in collection trends and changes in payor behavior. &#160; &#160; 55 "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/899923/000156459020040011

For those contracts, the Company estimates variable consideration (e.g., award or incentive fees) and the estimated costs at completion (EAC).&#160;&#160;Changes in variable consideration and contract EACs can occur over the contract performance period for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope and schedule and technical issues that may affect the award or incentive fee earned and total costs at completion.&#160;&#160;Significant changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. Auditing revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion method involved subjective auditor judgment because the Company's estimates include time and materials necessary to complete the contract and management's expectation of award and incentive fees that will be earned.&#160;&#160;These estimates are based on management's assessment of the current status of the contract as well as historical results. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit &#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's accounting for percentage of completion revenue recognition. For example, we tested controls over the determination of significant assumptions regarding award or incentive fees that will be earned, future costs based on the current status of the contract, and changes in EAC estimates. To test the estimate of revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion method, our audit procedures included among others, comparing estimates of hours and materials and award or incentive fees to historical results of similar contracts, agreeing the key terms, including the terms of the award and incentive fees, to contract documentation and management's estimates, and obtaining an understanding of contract performance through review of customer correspondence. &#160; "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16058/000156459020040205

Evaluation of net realizable value of inventories &#160;and losses on inventory purchase obligations As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. As of June 27, 2020, the Company held inventories of $102.0 million. The Company records a write-down for excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions.&#160;&#160;Additionally, a liability and a charge is recorded to cost of sales for estimated losses on inventory the Company is obligated to purchase from contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule, cancels its order, or for other factors.&#160;&#160; We identified the evaluation of net realizable value of inventories associated with excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations as a critical audit matter.&#160;&#160;A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's estimate of net realizable value for these inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations. Specifically, there is a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the effect of any unexpected or sudden declines in market demand which may result from changes to or cancellations of customer orders, rapid product or technological advances, due to the nature of the evidence available related to these factors. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company's process to develop the estimated net realizable value of inventory and recognition of losses related to outstanding inventory purchase obligations. We assessed the Company's assumptions by comparing them to historical activity and demand forecasts. We also considered customer communications, as well as end user and third-party publications. We performed an analysis to recalculate the required write-downs and losses and we compared this to the recorded amounts. We inspected reporting from significant vendors regarding outstanding purchase obligations of the Company. Additionally, we tested returns which resulted from quality related issues of the Company's products during the year and subsequent to period-end to evaluate if additional write-downs or losses were warranted.

" SAVINGS INSTITUTION, FEDERALLY CHARTERED [6035]"	"Critical Audit Matter s &#160; The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.&#160;&#160;The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. &#160; Allowance for Loan Losses &#8211; Environmental Loss Factors &#160; As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects the Company's estimation of incurred losses in its loan portfolio to the extent they are both probable and reasonable to estimate.&#160;&#160;The allowance for loan losses was $37,327,000 at June 30, 2020, which consists of two components: the valuation allowance for loans individually evaluated for impairment (&#8220;specific reserves&#8221;), representing $89,000, and the valuation allowance for loans collectively evaluated for impairment (&#8220;general reserves&#8221;), representing $37,238,000. The general reserves are further broken down as reserves based on historical loss factors ($1,184,000) and environmental loss factors ($36,054,000). The calculation of the allowance for loan losses involves significant estimates and subjective assumptions which require a high degree of judgment relating to 1) the external operating environment, 2) the composition, terms and performance of Company's loan portfolio and 3) the Company's ability to monitor and manage the loan portfolio, and how those assumptions impact probable incurred losses within the loan portfolio.&#160; Changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the Company's financial results. &#160; Environmental loss factors are based on specific quantitative and qualitative criteria representing key sources of risk within the loan portfolio. Such sources of risk include those relating to the level of and trends in nonperforming loans, credit risk management effectiveness, lending resource capability, economic and market conditions, loan concentrations, loan composition and terms, independent loan review effectiveness, and collateral values, as well as the effects of other external factors. The outstanding principal balance of each applicable loan segment is multiplied by the applicable environmental loss factors to estimate the level of probable incurred losses based upon their supporting quantitative and qualitative criteria.&#160;&#160;Thus, the evaluation of these sources of risk results in environmental loss factors which contribute significantly to the general reserve component of the estimate of the allowance for loan losses.&#160; Management's allocation relies on a qualitative assessment of risks to determine the quantitative impact the issues have on the allowance.&#160;&#160;&#160;Management's identification and analysis of these issues requires significant judgment. We identified the estimate of the individual and aggregate environmental loss factors of the allowance for loan losses with respect to the multi-family mortgage and non-residential mortgage loan segments as a critical audit matter as it involved especially subjective auditor judgment. &#160; &#160; &#160; F-3 &#160; The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: &#160; - Testing the effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of the sources of risk used to estimate the environmental loss factors, including controls addressing: &#160; o Management's review of the accuracy of data inputs used as the basis for the adjustments relating to environmental loss factors. &#160; o Management's determination of loans excluded from the environmental loss factors calculation due to their status as acquired or impaired loans. &#160; o Management's review of the qualitative and quantitative conclusions related to the environmental loss factors and the resulting allocation to the allowance. &#160; - Substantively testing management's process, including evaluating their judgments and assumptions, for developing the environmental loss factors which included: &#160; o Evaluation of the completeness and accuracy of data inputs used as a basis for the adjustments relating to environmental loss factors. &#160; o Evaluation of loans excluded from the environmental loss factors calculation for propriety of classification as acquired or impaired loans. &#160; o Evaluation of the reasonableness of management's judgments related to the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the data used in the determination of environmental loss factors and the resulting allocation to the allowance.&#160; Among other procedures, our evaluation considered, the weight of confirming and disconfirming evidence from internal and external sources, loan portfolio performance and third-party data, and whether such assumptions were applied consistently period over period, and gave appropriate consideration to current economic factors. &#160; o Analytically evaluating the environmental loss factor allocation year over year and testing allocations for reasonableness. Goodwill Impairment Evaluation As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated goodwill balance was $210,895,000 at June 30, 2020, which is allocated to the Company's single reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment loss has occurred. The annual quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Company's single reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (&#8220;income approach&#8221;) and estimates of selected market information (&#8220;market approach&#8221;).&#160;The results of the income approach were weighted at 75% while the results of the market approach were weighted at 25%. The calculation of the goodwill impairment involves significant estimates and subjective assumptions which require a high degree of management judgment.&#160; This judgment includes, but is not limited to, the selection of appropriate discount rates, the identification of relevant market comparables and the development of cash flow projections. The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value. We identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the Company as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for this determination was the degree of auditor judgment in performing procedures over the key assumptions, which include discounted cash flows, discount rate, prospective financial information, and weighting allocation to valuation methodologies. &#160; &#160; F-4 &#160; The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: &#160; - Testing the effectiveness of controls over management's goodwill impairment test including controls addressing: &#160; o Management's review of the reasonableness and accuracy of the Company's prospective financial information used in the discounted cash flow methodology. &#160; o Managements evaluation of key assumptions used by a third-party valuation specialist, including discount rate, terminal growth rate, and control premium and allocated weightings incorporated into the methodologies used to determine fair value. &#160; - Substantively testing management's estimate, including evaluating their judgements and assumptions, for estimating fair value the Company which included: &#160; o Evaluation of key financial data for accuracy, including comparison of prospective financial information to the Company's strategic plan. &#160; o Evaluation of management's ability to reasonably forecast cash flows by comparing actual results to management's historical forecasts. &#160; o Utilization of a Crowe LLP employed valuation specialist to evaluate appropriateness of valuation methodologies, discount rate, control premium, and overall reasonableness of the fair value. &#160; o Evaluation of management's weighting allocation to each valuation methodology. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617242/000156459020041755

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Assessment of effect of international tax realignment As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company continued the realignment of its international structure in the current year. Assets acquired in the acquisition of Aerohive Networks, Inc. were transferred amongst legal entities residing in different tax jurisdictions, resulting in changes to the income tax provision and related disclosures. We identified the assessment of the effect of the international tax realignment as a critical audit matter. Due to the significance of the Company's foreign operations subject to the realignment of its international structure, there was complexity in assessing the implications of the realignment on the income tax provision and related disclosures. Complex auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's interpretation of applicable tax laws, regulations and the relevant topics of the accounting standards codification and their application to specific aspects of the Company's realignment activities. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's income tax process, including controls related to the identification and assessment of the tax and accounting positions taken due to the realignment. Due to the complexity of tax law, which is often subject to interpretation, combined with the complexity of applying the accounting requirements, we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating: &#160; - The Company's interpretation and application of tax laws and regulations, &#160; - The Company's application of relevant accounting guidance related to the accounting for income taxes, including the intra-entity transfer of assets, and&#160;&#160;business combinations, and &#160; - The Company's compliance with the intercompany agreements which were executed as part of the realignment.&#160;&#160; &#160; Evaluation of the estimated market value of finished goods inventory. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company assesses its finished goods inventory to identify excess or obsolete inventory and potential declines in its value. Finished goods inventory as of June 30, 2020 was $52.9 million. We identified the evaluation of the estimated market value of finished goods inventory as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management's assumptions used to evaluate whether they could sell certain inventory which has limited future product demand forecasted, due to the nature of the evidence available related to the expectation. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's process to assess excess or obsolete inventory. This included controls related to the determination of the estimated market value and the evaluation of management's assumptions used to evaluate whether they could&#160;&#160; sell certain inventory with limited future product demand forecasted. We challenged management's expectation to sell certain inventory by evaluating the historical results of similar assumptions management has made and by assessing the reasonableness of management's planned actions through independent corroboration. We performed an assessment of physical inventory disposals to determine whether inventory write-downs were taken in the correct period. We also performed inquiries with product line managers and examined product roadmaps to determine whether new product launches would contradict management's assumption that they could sell inventory with limited future product demand. 54 &#160; Evaluation of the fair value of certain intangible assets acquired in the Aerohive Networks, Inc. business combination As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 9, 2019, the Company acquired Aerohive Networks, Inc. (&#8220;Aerohive&#8221;) for total consideration of $267 million. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded various intangible assets, which included developed technology and customer relationships with an acquisition-date fair value of $39.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively. We identified the evaluation of the fair value of developed technology and customer relationships&#160;&#160;acquired in the Aerohive transaction as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjectivity in developing the key assumptions used to determine the acquisition-date fair value of these intangible assets.&#160;&#160;Specifically, the discounted cash flow models included internally-developed assumptions for which there was limited observable market information. In addition, the fair value of these intangible asset was sensitive to possible changes to the following key assumptions: Developed Technology: &#160; - Forecasted revenues, including technology life &#160; - Forecasted cost of sales and operating expenses, including research and development maintenance rates Customer Relationships: &#160; - Forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, and taxes (EBIT) margins &#160; - Estimated annual customer retention rate The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's acquisition-date valuation process to develop the key assumptions, as listed above. We evaluated the Company's forecasted revenues, annual customer retention rate, and EBIT margins attributable to customer relationships by comparing to relevant support including, where applicable, (a) peer group and market participant data, (b) actual EBIT margins for technology distributors, (c) industry reports, and (d) historical actual Aerohive results.&#160;&#160;We evaluated the forecasted revenues, technology life, costs of sales and operating expenses, and research and development maintenance rates attributable to developed technology by comparing to relevant support including, where applicable, (a)&#160;&#160;peer group and market participant data, (b) industry reports and (c) historical actual Aerohive results.&#160;&#160;In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: &#160; - Evaluating the valuation methodologies used by the Company&#59; &#160; - Evaluating the peer group and market participant data used in the assessment of assumptions noted above&#59; and &#160; - Assessing the reasonableness of technology life and research and development maintenance rates based on the nature of the technology acquired. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1078271/000156459020042032

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 70 Table of Contents Valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets Description of the Matter As reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements, at June&#160;30, 2020, the Company's goodwill was $3,951&#160;million and indefinite-lived intangible assets were $947&#160;million. As disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment require the performance of an interim impairment assessment. As a result of these assessments, the Company recognized impairments of $1,098&#160;million on goodwill and $194&#160;million on indefinite-lived intangible assets during the year ended June&#160;30, 2020. Auditing management's impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant measurement uncertainty in determining the fair values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In particular, the fair value estimates of the reporting units were sensitive to changes in significant assumptions such as discount rates, revenue growth rates, operating margins, estimated spend on capital expenditures, terminal growth rates and market multiples. The fair value estimates for indefinite-lived intangible assets were sensitive to significant assumptions such as discount rates, revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and terminal growth rates. These assumptions are affected by expected future market or economic conditions, including the impact of COVID-19. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment process. For example, we tested controls over the Company's long range planning process as well as controls over the review of the significant assumptions in estimating the fair values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. To test the fair values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, our audit procedures included assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions and underlying data used by the Company. This included forecasted revenue including subscriber growth, customer churn, and new product launches. We compared the significant assumptions used in the Company's long range plan, including forecasted revenue and operating margins, to current industry and economic trends, including the impact of COVID-19, while also considering changes in the Company's business model, customer base and product mix. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing past projections to actual performance and assessed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulting from changes in the assumptions. We also involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the Company's models, valuation methodology, and significant assumptions used in the fair value estimates. We tested management's reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. Impairment of property, plant, and equipment Description of the Matter As reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements, at June&#160;30, 2020, the Company's property, plant and equipment balance was $2,256 million. As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2020 the Company recorded property, plant and equipment impairment charges of $203 million at News UK and News Corp Australia due to the impact of adverse print advertising and print circulation trends on the future expected performance of the business, which were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company evaluated its property, plant and equipment in these locations for recoverability and concluded that certain assets were impaired. Auditing the Company's impairment assessments involved subjective auditor judgment due to the significant estimation involved in determining the fair values, including the projected cash flows used to evaluate the recoverability and the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair values of long-lived assets for which impairment was indicated. 71 Table of Contents How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to measure impairments of property, plant and equipment. Our audit procedures included, among others, testing controls over the Company's long range planning process as well as controls over the review of the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the property, plant and equipment. Our testing of the Company's impairment of property, plant and equipment included, among other procedures, evaluating the Company's long range plan by comparing the significant assumptions to current industry and economic trends, including the impact of COVID-19, changes in the Company's business model, customer base or product mix and also assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates. We audited management's forecasted print advertising revenue and print circulation revenue streams to identify, understand and evaluate the changes as compared to the historical results. We reviewed the valuation methodology to assess whether the methodology is widely recognized and appropriate for use in the valuation of the property, plant and equipment, tested the data used in the valuation, and recalculated the valuation estimate based on the applicable inputs. We also involved our valuation specialists to assist in our assessment of the valuation approach and assumptions used to estimate the fair value. Assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records a valuation allowance based on the assessment of the realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets. For the year-ended June&#160;30, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of $2.2&#160;billion. Auditing management's assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions involved subjective estimation and complex auditor judgment in determining whether sufficient future taxable income, including projected pre-tax income, will be generated to support the realization of the existing deferred tax assets before expiration. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls over management's projections of pre-tax income. Among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the assumptions used by the Company to develop projections of future taxable income, including the pre-tax income, by income tax jurisdiction and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the projections. For example, we compared the projections of pre-tax income with the actual results of prior periods, as well as management's consideration of current industry and economic trends, including the impact of COVID-19. We also compared the projections of future pre-tax income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company. "	https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564708/000156470820000022

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level on April 1 unless an interim test is required due to the presence of indicators that goodwill may be impaired. The Company's goodwill is initially assigned to its reporting units as of the acquisition date. Auditing management's annual goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting units. Fair value is estimated by management based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow model as well as market-based approaches. In particular, the fair value estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and the use of comparable market multiples of various financial measures, which are affected by expected future market or economic conditions, including increased uncertainty as of the measurement date due to the impact of COVID-19. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment testing process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant inputs and assumptions discussed above used in determining the reporting unit fair values. To test the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the methodologies used and testing the significant assumptions discussed above, including the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. For example, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, historical financial results and other relevant factors. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the reporting units resulting from changes in the inputs and assumptions. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management's projections. In addition, we involved our valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the significant assumptions described above. We evaluated the reconciliation of the estimated aggregate fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. Investment in FFF Enterprises Description of the Matter As disclosed in Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, and pursuant to the terms of a shareholders' agreement, the Company owns 49% of the outstanding stock of FFF Enterprises, Inc. (&#8220;FFF&#8221;). The majority shareholder of FFF holds a put right that provides such shareholder the right to require the Company to purchase the majority shareholder's interest in FFF, on an all or nothing basis, on or after April 15, 2023. In addition, the Company has a call right that provides it the option to purchase the remaining interest in FFF after (i) a Key Man Event (as defined in Note 6) has occurred, or (ii) on January 30, 2021. Auditing the fair value determination of the put and call rights was challenging because of the use of significant inputs and assumptions, including the forecast of FFF's EBITDA and enterprise value over the option period, forecasted movements in the overall market, and likelihood of a Key Man Event, in determining the fair values. Changes in these inputs and assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair values of the put and call rights. Also, applying audit procedures to address the estimation uncertainty involved a high degree of auditor judgment. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the relevant controls over management's calculation of fair value. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the inputs and assumptions discussed above used in determining the fair values of the put and call rights. To test the estimated fair values of the put and call rights, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the methodologies used and testing the significant assumptions discussed above, including the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. For example, we compared the revenue growth and profitability assumptions to past performance of FFF and other guideline companies within the same industry. We also assessed the Company's application of the terms of the shareholders' agreement in its valuation methodology and agreed the terms to the inputs used in the fair value calculations. In addition, we involved our valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions discussed above. 87 Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Description of the Matter As disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal 2020 the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Acurity, Inc. and Nexera Inc. for consideration of $203 million, including an earn-out opportunity for Acurity, Inc. of up to $30 million based upon the Company's achievement of a range of member renewals on terms consistent with prevailing market conditions in December 2023. The Company has accounted for the acquisition as a business combination whereby the purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values. Auditing the Company's accounting for the acquisition was complex due to the estimation uncertainty involved in determining the fair value of intangible assets of $188 million, consisting primarily of acquired member relationships of $166 million, and the fair value of contingent consideration payable to an affiliate of a limited partner in Premier Healthcare Alliance, L.P. The estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to the significant underlying assumptions. Significant assumptions used by management in the valuation of the intangible assets included the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of contingent consideration included estimated achievement of a range of member renewals in December 2023. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration related to the business combination. This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and measurement of identified intangible assets and contingent consideration, including management's evaluation of underlying assumptions and estimates used to determine these fair values. To test the estimated fair value of the intangible assets and contingent consideration, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the significant assumptions used, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodologies used by the Company and testing certain significant assumptions used to value the intangible assets and contingent consideration. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to current economic trends, historical results of the acquired businesses and to other relevant factors. We also performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value resulting from changes in the assumptions.

Evaluation of certain assumptions underlying the product warranty liability for certain brands As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's product warranty liability as of June 30, 2020 was $27.5 million. The product warranty liability represents estimated future costs to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period for each boat sold. The Company's estimated future costs to repair or replace defective products includes assumptions regarding the anticipated warranty costs per boat by brand. We identified the evaluation of the anticipated warranty costs per boat that are used to estimate the product warranty liability for Malibu, Axis and Cobalt branded boats as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's estimate of the anticipated warranty costs per boat, due to the nature of the audit evidence. Specifically, for Axis and Malibu model years prior to 2016, historical claims experience only exists for a warranty term of two and three years, respectively. For Cobalt model years prior to 2018, historical claims experience only exists for 67 Table of Contents a warranty term of three years. This historical claims experience is shorter in duration than the five-year warranty term associated with the Company's current warranty program. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's warranty accrual process. This included controls over the development of the assumptions used to estimate the warranty cost per boat for warranty years four and five, for which little or no historical claims experience exists. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential for possible changes to these assumptions on the product warranty liability. We assessed the Company's historical claims experience and the relationship between the historical warranty costs per boat incurred by warranty year. We further assessed the Company's assumptions underlying the anticipated warranty costs per boat for warranty years four and five by considering warranty claims received after year-end but before the consolidated financial statements were issued, to identify trends not considered by the Company when it developed its assumptions. We also compared the Company's prior year product warranty liability related to claims expected to be incurred in the current year to actual claims received in the current year to evaluate the historical accuracy of the Company's estimates.

Measurement of uncertain tax positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded income tax expense related to US and non-US tax paying jurisdictions totaling $39.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 and a liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaling $4.4 million at June 30, 2020. The Company's accounting for income taxes involves the application of complex tax regulations in each of the international tax paying jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination of income subject to income tax in each tax paying jurisdiction requires management to apply transfer pricing guidelines for certain intercompany transactions related to certain European countries and make assumptions and estimates about the value of transactions when allocating income and deductions between consolidated entities in different tax paying jurisdictions. The estimates and assumptions used in these allocations can result in uncertainty in the measured tax benefit. Auditing the completeness and measurement of the liability for recognized tax benefits related to certain intercompany transactions was complex because the assumptions are based on the interpretation of tax laws and legal rulings in multiple tax paying jurisdictions and require significant judgment in determining whether a tax position's technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. 67 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the process to assess the technical merits of tax positions related to certain intercompany transactions, as well as management's process to measure the benefit of those tax positions, including controls over the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the evaluation of matters identified by and discussed with various tax authorities. Our audit procedures with respect to the calculation of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits involved an assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax positions performed with the assistance of tax subject matter professionals with knowledge of and experience with the application of international and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating third-party advice obtained by the Company and making inquiries of its external tax advisers. We also evaluated the Company's significant assumptions and the completeness and accuracy of the data used to determine the amount of tax benefits recognized and tested the accuracy of such calculations. Fair value of derivative liability Description of the Matter During May 2019, the Company entered into an equity commitment and investment agreement for the issuance and sale of 650,000 shares of Catalent's Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $650.0 million. As discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Series A Preferred Stock included a dividend adjustment feature that met the definition of a derivative for accounting purposes. The dividend adjustment feature was bifurcated from the Series A Preferred Stock and recorded separately as a derivative liability and has a $23.6 million balance as of June 30, 2020. Auditing the Company's valuation of this derivative was challenging as the Company uses complex valuation methodologies that incorporate significant assumptions which include the discount rate and forecasted volatility of the Company's common stock price. The valuation includes assumptions about economic and market conditions with uncertain future outcomes. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the risks of material misstatement relating to the valuation of the derivative liability. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the valuation models, the underlying assumptions used in the model and the related accounting conclusions. To test the valuation of the derivative liability, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used in the valuation model and testing the significant assumptions. For example, we compared the discount rate that was adjusted for the Company's credit risk to the interest rates on comparable debt instruments, and we compared the forecasted volatility of the Company's common stock price to its historical volatility. We also assessed the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We involved our internal valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the significant assumptions and methodologies used by the Company. We have also evaluated the Company's financial statement disclosures related to these matters included in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

SERVICES-MISCELLANEOUS AMUSEMENT & RECREATION [7990]	"Critical Audit Matter s The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of the identification of related parties and related party transactions As discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Dolan family, including trusts for the benefit of members of the Dolan family (collectively, the Dolan Family Group) is the majority beneficial owner of the Company, MSG Networks Inc. (MSG Networks), Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. (MSG Entertainment), and AMC Networks Inc. (AMC Networks). In addition, there are certain overlapping directors and executive officers between the companies. Each of these entities is a related party. Following the distribution of MSG Entertainment, the Company has entered into a number of transactions with MSG Entertainment, including agreements for use of the Madison Square Garden Arena, sales and service representation agreements, sponsorship allocation, transition services and delayed draw term loans, as well as certain shared executive support costs for the Company's Executive Chairman and Vice Chairman. The Company has entered into agreements for media rights and other transactions with MSG Networks and the Company has also entered into transactions with AMC F- 2 Networks. Further, the Company has entered into several arrangements with members of the Dolan Family Group for shared office space and aircraft services and timesharing. We identified the evaluation of the identification of related parties and related party transactions as a critical audit matter. Auditor judgment was involved in assessing the sufficiency of the procedures performed to identify related parties and related party transactions of the Company. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's related party process, including controls over the identification of the Company's related party relationships and transactions. We performed the following procedures to evaluate the identification of related parties and related party transactions by the Company: - Read new agreements and contracts between the Company and related parties - Queried the accounts payable system for transactions with related parties; - Inspected director and officer questionnaires from the Company's directors and officers; - Evaluated the Company's reconciliation of its applicable accounts to the related parties' records of transactions and balances; - Read the Company's minutes from meetings of the Board of Directors and related committees; - Inquired with executive officers, key members of management, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regarding related party transactions. - Received confirmations from related parties and compared responses to the Company's records; - Read public filings, external news, and research sources for information related to transactions between the Company and related parties; and - Listened to the Company's quarterly investor relations calls. Assessment of the results from discontinued operations As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 17, 2020, the Company distributed all the outstanding common stock of MSG Entertainment to its stockholders. MSG Entertainment owns, directly or indirectly, the entertainment and sports booking businesses previously owned and operated by the Company through its Entertainment and Sports business segments, respectively. Management determined that the allocable shared revenue and expenses of MSG Entertainment should be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. We identified the assessment of the results from discontinued operations as a critical audit matter. Given the nature of the transactions and the degree of integration of MSG Entertainment with the Company's continuing operations in the periods before the distribution, there was a high degree of subjective auditor judgment required to assess management's identification, segregation, and recording of the allocable shared revenue and expenses for the discontinued businesses. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's discontinued operations assessment process, including controls related to the identification, segregation, and recording of allocable shared revenue and expenses, and the resulting entries made to the income statement account balances. Specifically, we read the distribution agreements and evaluated the Company's discontinued operations accounting memorandums that document management's accounting conclusions. We tested the recognition and classification of amounts included in discontinued operations by recalculating revenue and expenses using the Company's historical accounting records. We read the Company's disclosure and assessed whether the disclosure appropriately described the determination of discontinued operations.

1748790	 Amcor plc	 MISCELLANEOUS MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES [3990]	"Critical Audit Matter s The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America Reporting Units within the Flexibles Segment As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated goodwill balance was $5,339.3 million at June 30, 2020, and the goodwill associated with the Flexibles Segment was $4,369.1 million, which includes goodwill associated with the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units. Management conducts an impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Management performed a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment, utilizing present value (discounted cash flow) methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, management would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill. Management's projected future cash flows for the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units included significant judgments and assumptions relating to revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units within the Flexibles Segment is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management's projected future cash flows and significant assumptions, including revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment analysis, including controls over the valuation of the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the models; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including 45 revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. Evaluating management's assumptions related to revenue growth, projected operating income growth, and terminal values involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company's discounted cash flow models and certain significant assumptions, including the terminal values and discount rates.
